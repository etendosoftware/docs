    The new version [25.1](./release-notes/etendo-classic/release-notes.md) of Etendo introduces the latest stack enhancements. While this version is currently in Release Candidate (RC) status, you can already explore the detailed [API changelog](../developer-guide/etendo-classic/developer-changelog/apichanges.md) to review the changes and improvements included in this release.

- :material-trending-up: **Fixed Issue**
    
    ---
    As of version [24.3.7](./release-notes/etendo-classic/release-notes.md), a bug affecting dropdown selectors in dimensional reports has been fixed. In environments running Etendo 24.3.6 or earlier, the first record in combo boxes was displayed incorrectly, showing a concatenation of all values instead of the correct individual value. This issue was caused by improper handling of `<option>` tags in HTML.

    The bug has been resolved in 24.3.7, and Etendo 24.4.0 or later was not affected, as the refactor to fix the issue was already included in that version.
