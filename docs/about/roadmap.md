### Bulk Posting
The Bulk Posting functionality allows the user to post or unpost multiple records by selecting the corresponding records and clicking the “Bulk posting” button. Also, the Accounting Status of the record/s is shown in the status bar, in form view, or in a column, in grid view.

### Business Partner Settlement Advanced
This module includes enhancements to the "Business Partner Settlements" module, 
Managing credit settlements or pending business partner payments from the payments and collections window, as well as from the reconciliations, creating the settlement of payments/receivables automatically.

### Advanced Business Partner
This module improves business partner information management by creating a new window that displays business partner information grouped by client, vendor, employee sections, and all tabs from business partner windows. It also adds the capability to create a number sequence for each business partner based on the business partner category, with options for automatic number sequencing or deletion and modification of generated document numbers.

### Payment In/Out Report Advanced
The payment report currently has interface and parameter issues, such as showing the last business partner when a payment has no business partner and incorrect grouping/ordering by field values. This module aims to fix these issues.

### Remittance Advanced
This module enhances the remittance creation process by allowing selection of a custom bank account for every invoice/order, modifying the pick and edit windows, and the process that adds remittance lines. It also migrates the button to the Etendo remittance module and adds filtering options by selecting orders.

### PSD2 Bank Account Integration
This functionality enables connecting to a bank to synchronize bank accounts with financial accounts in Etendo, downloading transactions for reconciliation, and automating the process for subsequent downloads of bank transactions.

### Openbravo Integration
This connector allows for bidirectional data synchronization between Etendo and Openbravo instances, while also accommodating customizations made by customers.

### Advanced Security
This development focuses on strengthening security measures, including requiring a minimum password length, incorporating numbers, lowercase/uppercase letters, and symbols in passwords, enforcing password renewal after a certain period, providing warnings before password expiration, blocking users after consecutive failed login attempts, preventing users with active sessions from logging in again, and disallowing password reuse over time.

### Advanced Production Management
This module aims to accelerate the production process in Etendo by enabling booking and pre-booking of purchase orders associated with production, generating purchase proposals for manufacturing, and generating orders from purchase proposals.
