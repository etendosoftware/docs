# Data Mappings in Etendo: An Overview

## Introduction

Data mapping in Etendo facilitates the accurate translation and transfer of data from one system to another. It is essential for integrating disparate systems, ensuring consistency and compatibility across data formats.

## What is Data Mapping?

Data mapping serves as the core mechanism for data integration and transformation within Etendo. It is the process of linking data fields from one database to another, ensuring that data flows correctly between systems and applications.

### Types of Data Mappings:

1. **Direct Mapping:** Connects individual fields from one data source directly to corresponding fields in another, enabling straightforward data transfer.
2. **Entity Mapping:** Involves the alignment of complex data structures, such as mapping entire data objects from one system to corresponding objects in another.
3. **Custom Mapping:** Allows for intricate data transformations and mappings that do not follow direct or entity mapping patterns, accommodating complex business logic and data requirements.

## Functionality and Importance

Data mapping ensures that data, when moved or integrated from one source to another, maintains its accuracy, context, and value. This process is crucial for operational efficiency, especially in environments that utilize multiple systems and require consistent data flow and integrity.

## Data Mapping Process

The mapping process involves defining how data fields correspond between sources. This includes specifying the source and destination of each data element, the data transformation rules, and how data inconsistencies are handled. The goal is to streamline data processes and ensure that data remains coherent and usable across different applications and systems.
