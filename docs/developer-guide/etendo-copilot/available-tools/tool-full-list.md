## Best Practices

### Security Considerations
- Always validate input parameters before using tools
- Use appropriate authentication mechanisms (OAuth tokens, API keys)
- Ensure user permissions are respected for file operations
- Sanitize file paths and URLs to prevent security vulnerabilities

### Performance Optimization
- Cache frequently accessed data using the Memory Tool
- Use batch operations when possible (e.g., multiple file operations)
- Consider file size limitations for processing tools
- Optimize search queries for better performance

### Error Handling
- Always check tool responses for error conditions
- Implement fallback mechanisms for critical operations
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Provide meaningful error messages to users

## Configuration Requirements

Most tools require specific configuration settings:

### Environment Variables
- API keys for external services (Tavily, Google APIs)
- Authentication tokens and credentials
- File system permissions (`COPILOT_WRITE_RULE`)
- Service endpoints and URLs

### Dependencies
- Chroma vector database for Memory Tool
- Docker runtime for Docker Tool
- Python libraries for various processing tools
- Network access for API and download tools

## Support and Troubleshooting

For issues with specific tools:

1. Check the individual tool documentation for configuration requirements
2. Verify all required environment variables are set
3. Ensure proper permissions for file system operations
4. Validate network connectivity for external service tools
5. Review error logs for detailed debugging information
