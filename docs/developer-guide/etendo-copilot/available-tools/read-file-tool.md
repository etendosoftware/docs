# Read File Tool

## Overview
The **Read File Tool** is designed to read the contents of files given a filepath parameter. It provides a simple way to access the contents of text files on the local system.

## Functionality

This tool is especially useful when you need to access the contents of a file for processing or viewing. It can be used in several situations, such as:

- Reading configuration files.
- Accessing logs and log files.
- Viewing or processing data stored in text files.

This process consists of the following actions.

- **Receiving Parameters**

    The tool receives an input parameter called `filepath` which is the path to the file to be read.

- **Converting JSON**
    If the input is a JSON string, it tries to convert it to a dictionary. If the input is a dictionary directly, it uses it as is.
    If the parameter is directly a string representing the path, it handles that case also by converting it to a dictionary.

- **Reading File**
    - It opens the file specified by `filepath`.
    - It reads the entire contents of the file.

- **Returning the Result**
    It returns a dictionary with the contents of the file under the `message` key.

## Usage Example

If you want to read the contents of the `/tmp/test.txt` file:
    
- **Input**
```
{ "filepath": "/tmp/test.txt" }
```
- **Output**
```
{ "message": "Content of the read file..." }
```
