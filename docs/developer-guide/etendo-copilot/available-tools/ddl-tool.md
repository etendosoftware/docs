## Overview

The **DDLTool** is a Python file that can register a table on Etendo System through a Copilot chat. It can also create a table on the database by adding mandatory columns and specific columns that the user wants. After all of these functionalities the tool create and register a window and a menu on the system for the data can be showed.

## Functionality

The **DDLTool** works with modes, each for a specific action. Through the prompt, the assistant can infer the mode is needed to do the task request by the user, the tool has a variable that contains a list with the availables modes, and with the prompt the assistant choose wich is better for the task.

Users can choose modes using the chat:

- **REGISTER_TABLE:** This mode registers a table on the Etendo System, creating a table header. It requires a table name and a prefix of a module in development. The tool can infer fields like Java Class Name, Description, and Help. This mode has a method that fis the java class name with a camelcase style. The tool uses a webhook to execute a Java file to check if a table name is already registered and then sets parameters with Etendo methods.

- **CREATE_TABLE:** Creates a table on the database using the table name and prefix to build the query with mandatory columns and necessary constraints. The mandatory constraints with the ad_org and ad_client table are created withe a method that fix the name if these are longer that 32 characters. This query is executed in the database with an Etendo webhook that runs a Java file.

- **ADD_COLUMN:** Similar to CREATE_TABLE mode, but modifies the previously created table instead of creating a new one. The tool has a list of acceptable data types for each column and this is chosen by the assistant, that also infers if the column can have a null value or if it needs a default value. If unsure, it waits for more information. It can generate the correct query if the column data type needs a constraint.

- **REGISTER_COLUMNS:** Acts like REGISTER_TABLE and executes automatically after the ADD_COLUMN mode. It creates columns on Etendo System from the database by calling a webhook that runs a Java file.

- **SYNC_TERMINOLOGY:** Cleans the terminology, removing "_" and adding spaces. It works by calling a webhook to execute a Java file.

- **REGISTER_FIELDS:** Registers the fields of a tab in Etendo System to be recognized for it. It works by calling a webhook to run a Java file.

- **REGISTER_WINDOW_AND_TAB:** Registers a window and a table to show the data in the application. It first checks if there is a window already created with the same name. If necessary, the tool can force the creation with a parameter called ForceCreate.

## Example

**User**: "I want to create a table with the name 'Table Test' and prefix 'copdev', the rest of necessary information must be generated by you"

**Copilot**: "The table 'Table Test' has been created successfully in the database. Now, let's define the specific columns for this table. Could you please specify the columns you'd like to add, including details like column name, data type, whether the column can be null, and any default values? If you're unsure about the available data types, let me know, and I can provide a list."

**User**: "I want to add the column 'Specific Data' with the type text"

**Copilot**: "The terminology synchronization process was completed successfully, ensuring that the labels and names for the fields are set up correctly. The complete process for registering the table 'Table Test' with a new window and fields has been successfully completed. You may now compile and restart Etendo to see the changes take effect and start using the new table in the application interface. If you need further assistance or have any more requests, feel free to let me know!"
