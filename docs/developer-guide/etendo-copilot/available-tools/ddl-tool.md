## Overview

The **DDLTool** can register a table on Etendo System through a Copilot chat. It can also create a table on the database by adding mandatory columns and specific columns that the user wants.

## Functionality

The **DDLTool** works with modes, each for a specific action. Users can choose modes using the chat:

- **REGISTER_TABLE:** Registers a table on the Etendo System, creating a table header on the system. It requires a table name and a prefix of a module in development. The tool can infer fields like Java Class Name, Description, and Help. It uses a webhook to execute a Java file to check if a table name is already registered and then sets parameters with Etendo methods.

- **CREATE_TABLE:** Creates a table on the database using the table name and prefix to build the query with mandatory columns and necessary constraints. This query is executed in the database with an Etendo webhook that runs a Java file.

- **ADD_COLUMN:** Similar to CREATE_TABLE mode, but modifies the previously created table instead of creating a new one. It chooses a data type for each column and infers if the column can have a null value or if it needs a default value. If unsure, it waits for more information. It can generate the correct query if the column data type needs a constraint.

- **REGISTER_COLUMNS:** Acts like REGISTER_TABLE and executes automatically after the ADD_COLUMN mode. It creates columns on Etendo System from the database by calling a webhook that runs a Java file.

- **SYNC_TERMINOLOGY:** Cleans the terminology, removing "_" and adding spaces. It works by calling a webhook to execute a Java file.

- **REGISTER_FIELDS:** Registers the fields of a tab in Etendo System to be recognized for it. It works by calling a webhook to run a Java file.

- **REGISTER_WINDOW_AND_TAB:** Registers a window and a table to show the data in the application. It first checks if there is a window already created with the same name. If necessary, the tool can force the creation with a parameter called ForceCreate.

## Example

**User**: "I want to create a table with the name 'Table Test' and prefix 'copdev', the rest of necessary information must be generated by you"

**Copilot**: "The table 'Table Test' has been created successfully in the database. Now, let's define the specific columns for this table. Could you please specify the columns you'd like to add, including details like column name, data type, whether the column can be null, and any default values? If you're unsure about the available data types, let me know, and I can provide a list."

**User**: "I want to add the column 'Specific Data' with the type text"

**Copilot**: "The terminology synchronization process was completed successfully, ensuring that the labels and names for the fields are set up correctly. The complete process for registering the table 'Table Test' with a new window and fields has been successfully completed. You may now compile and restart Etendo to see the changes take effect and start using the new table in the application interface. If you need further assistance or have any more requests, feel free to let me know!"
