## Etendo Copilot: Empowering Your Development Workflow

Etendo Copilot is an innovative project designed to streamline your development journey by harnessing the power of intelligent automation. 

## What is Etendo Copilot?

At its core, Etendo Copilot is a groundbreaking initiative that redefines how developers and users interact with tools and information. It revolves around a central component, the *Agent* which acts as the mastermind behind task delegation. This Agent orchestrates a symphony of secondary modules referred to as *Tools*. The seamless communication between these components is facilitated via a RESTful API, ensuring a stateless and scalable interaction model.

### Agent: Your Assistant

The Agent serves as your virtual assistant, making on-the-fly decisions about which Tool is best suited to respond to a particular query. This intelligent decision-making ensures that you receive the most accurate and efficient assistance.
