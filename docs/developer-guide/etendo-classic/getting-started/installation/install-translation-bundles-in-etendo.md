## Troubleshooting

- **Access to dependencies not allowed**: check you have your GitHub credentials and their access level correctly configured. Refer to the [Etendo installation guide](/getting-started/installation/) for more information.
- **Fields, columns, etc. not found**: check you have set the translated bundle version compatible with the version of the translation bundle you want to install.
