##  Overview

According to Wikipedia "Deep linking, on the World Wide Web, is making a
hyperlink that points to a specific page or image on a website, instead of
that website's main or home page. Such links are called deep links"  [1]  , in
the case of Openbravo ERP is the way to link with a URL directly to an
specific functionality, e.g. a Window/Tab, a Manual Form, etc. This link can
be built and attach it in a email, or copy/paste it in a IM window, etc.

##  Retrieving a direct/deep link

The Openbravo user interface makes it very easy to retrieve an url to a
window, tab and specific record (in a child tab). See the icon in the top of
the Openbravo window.

This icon can be clicked to create a direct link to a tab:

This example shows the direct link to the sales invoice header tab.

##  Structure of the URL

    
    
    http://server:port/obcontext/?params

  * **http://** The protocol to access the application (can be https if is an SSL enabled instance) 
  * **server** The name or IP address of the server 
  * **port** The port to access (If configured with Apache Httpd in front of tomcat is not necessary) 
  * **/obcontext** The name of the Openbravo context (required) 
  * **?params** The list of parameters to access an specific window or form. 

More information of the structure of an URL  [2]

The following parameters are supported:

  * **tabId** (mandatory) the id of the tab to which you want to link 
  * **recordId** the id of the record to be shown in the tab 
  * **command** the command parameter can be used to show the form in New mode, only one command is supported: NEW 

Note:

  * linking to a (grand-)child tab only makes sense when also a recordId (of the record to be shown in the child tab) is defined. This is needed to determine which parent record to load in the parent tab 
  * when the recordId parameter is used, the tab will always open in form mode 

Here are some examples of hyperlinks:

  * http://localhost:8080/openbravo/?tabId=263  link to the sales invoice header 
  * http://localhost:8080/openbravo/?tabId=263&recordId=FF808181304ACF4201304AE46E4B003E  link to a specific sales invoice 
  * http://localhost:8080/openbravo/?tabId=270&recordId=00C1DB5F5AB241D2A574B8CEBF482F8F  link to a specific sales invoice line 
  * http://localhost:8080/openbravo/?tabId=263&command=NEW  opens the sales invoice header window in NEW mode
