## Overview

Both check constraints and triggers are objects defined physically in database. This document will not explain the basis for triggers and constraints but just the particularities Etendo ERP has in their usage.

##  Naming

When adding a check constraint, triggers and indexes modularity naming rules have to be taken into account. This is because triggers and indexes are global objects for a database. 

The modularity naming rule is as follows: 
the constraint, index or trigger name must start with the DB Prefix of the module the constraint belongs to. 

For instance,`_MYMODULEDBPREFIX_CONSTRAINTNAME_`.

In the case of indexes and constraints, if the index/constraint is added to a
table of another module then an additional `_EM__ prefix` is required:

`_EM_MYMODULEDBPREFIX_CONSTRAINTNAME_`.

By following this naming rule the index/trigger/constraint is exported to the
module directory and packaged with the module.

!!!info
    The name of the constraints and triggers must not exceed the 30 characters as the maximum length of an object name in oracle is 30 characters.  

##  Constraints

Check constraints do not have any particularity in Etendo, except for how they should be named and how the back-end treats them to show messages.

A step by step HowTo on `_How to add a Constraint_` can be found here:

###  Messages

It is possible to define a message to be shown when the rule defined by the constraint is not satisfied. 

!!!info
    How to do that is explained in the Messages documentation.

###  Backwards compatibility

Modules should allow compatibility for other ones built on top of them at least between minor versions, additionally there could be user data already in the application if it is in a productive environment. 
This means that user data or other module's could rely in the current database model and in case a new constraint is added or an existent one is modified to be more restrictive
than it was, backwards compatibility could be broken. Therefore it should be avoided to add new constraints or to modify existent ones to make them more restrictive during between versions.

##  Indexes

###  Operator Classes

  
In `PostgreSQL  Operator Classes`  certain operator classes (`text_pattern_ops`,
`varchar_pattern_ops`, and `bpchar_pattern_ops`) enables using indexes in queries
involving pattern matching expressions. For instance, the following query:

    
```sql   
    SELECT name
    FROM c_bpartner
    WHERE name LIKE 'John%'
```
would not use an index created like this:

    
```sql   
    CREATE INDEX c_bpartner_name
      ON c_bpartner
      USING btree
      (name COLLATE pg_catalog."default");
```

but would use an index defined with an operator class:

    
```sql 
    CREATE INDEX c_bpartner_name
      ON c_bpartner
      USING btree
      (name COLLATE pg_catalog."default" varchar_pattern_ops);
```

Operator Classes are not needed in Oracle to use an index in the previously defined query, in that case if the index column defines an operator class, the operator class will have no effect.

###  Function based indexes

  
Etendo  supports the use of functions in indexes. For instance, this along with the use of an operator class, would enable the use of indexes in case insensitive queries that use the iStartsWith operator, like this one:

    
```sql
    SELECT name
    FROM c_bpartner
    WHERE UPPER(name) LIKE 'JOHN%'
```

The following index could be used by the previous query:

    
```sql
    CREATE INDEX c_bpartner_name
      ON c_bpartner
      USING btree
      (upper(name) COLLATE pg_catalog."default" varchar_pattern_ops);
```

Any function can be used in the indexes, as long as it is deterministic. Even
needed functions are supported:

    
```sql 
    CREATE INDEX c_bpartner_name
      ON c_bpartner
      USING btree
      (UPPER(REPLACE(name, 'a', 'b')));
```
The following index can also be used.

    
```sql
    CREATE INDEX c_bpartner_name_id
      ON c_bpartner
      USING btree
      (UPPER(REPLACE(name, 'a', 'b')),
       UPPER(c_bpartner_id));
```

!!!info
    Functions used in indexes  must be immutable. It is
    possible to define custom immutable functions, previously only built-in immutable functions could be used in indexes.  
  
###  Partial indexes
  
`PostgreSQL` supports the definition of  partial indexes. A partial index is an index where it is possible to specify the rows that are indexed. This kind of indexes are useful for commonly used _WHERE_ conditions that use constant values.

Thus, with a partial index it is possible to index just the table data that is most commonly used, helping to reduce the amount of disk space used by the index.

A partial index can be created as follows:

    
```sql
    CREATE INDEX a_amortization_active 
      ON a_amortization (isactive)
      WHERE isactive = 'Y';
```

For the moment Oracle does not support the creation of partial indexes in a explicit way. For this reason, if a partial index is found in the Etendo XML model when using an Oracle database, the partial index definition will not be taken into account and it will be created as a regular index.
  
####  Not Null Partial Indexes On Nullable Columns

In an Oracle database, it does not include rows in an index if the indexed columns are NULL. That means that for the case where we are indexing a nullable foreign key column **every index is a partial index** .

This is **not** the behavior in PostgresSQL databases, where we will need to define the index as partial to get the same behavior. For example:

    
```sql 
    CREATE INDEX c_order_return_reason 
      ON c_order (c_return_reason_id)
      WHERE c_return_reason_id IS NOT NULL;
```

###  Indexes for Contains Search

  
The indexes for _contains_ search, are those intended to provide fast searching of sub-strings within the values stored in a particular database column.

In PostgresSQL we can define a **contains** search index as follows:

    
```sql
    CREATE INDEX c_bpartner_value_basic ON c_bpartner USING gin (value gin_trgm_ops);
```

!!!note
    To define this kind of indexes we have to make use of the **` gin `
    ** access method together with the **` gin_trgm_ops ` ** operator class for
    the indexed column. Both elements are available thanks to the  ` pg_trgm `
    extension which is included in Etendo distribution by default.

Besides, this feature allows to define a  function based index  to improve
**icontains** (case insensitive) searching:

    
```sql
    `CREATE INDEX c_bpartner_value_basic ON c_bpartner USING gin (UPPER(value) gin_trgm_ops);`
```

!!!info
    For the moment, this kind of indexes are **not** supported in Oracle: if they are present in the XML model, they will be created as regular indexes in the database.

##  Triggers

A step by step HowTo on _How to add a Trigger_ can be found:  here

###  Syntax

Triggers, as the rest of `PL code` in Etendo ERP, should be written following
some restrictions in order to make them compatible between `PostgreSQL` and
Oracle and to make it possible to correctly export and import them using
`DBSourceManager`. These rules are detailed in the `PL-SQL` code rules
document.

###  Etendo Conventions

####  Exceptions and messages

Triggers can raise exceptions (it is the common practice to abort a
transaction), the back-end captures that exception in order to show a proper
message. 

!!!info
    For more information read in the message documentation how to do it.

####  Oracle's laziness

Whereas oracle evaluates expressions in a lazy manner `PostgreSQL` does not do
so. This specially important for triggers that are for `_insert_ and _delete_`
since in the first case there are: new variables and in the second one there
are: old ones, so when writing if clauses (even in Oracle if we want to do
compatible code) this must be taken into account writing two clauses instead
of just one.

####  Soft disabling

All triggers in Etendo ERP must be able to be disabled softly. This means
not disabling it in database but just in a logic way. 

This is used by DAL when it is importing data: triggers must be disabled in order to allow data
imporation without triggering them, but that only should affect to the session
that it is executing the importation. To add this capability to triggers, the
first lines of each of them should look like:

In Oracle

    
    
```sql
        IF AD_isTriggerEnabled()='N' THEN 
          RETURN;
        END IF;
```

In PostgreSQL

    
```sql
         IF AD_isTriggerEnabled()='N' THEN
            IF TG_OP = 'DELETE' THEN RETURN OLD; ELSE RETURN NEW; END IF;
         END IF;
```

####  Object returning

`PostgreSQL` trigger function must explicitly take care of returning the trigger
object, also depending on the type of the trigger. This means that the last
line of the trigger function must be something like:

    
    
    Â 
         `IF TG_OP = 'DELETE' THEN RETURN OLD; ELSE RETURN NEW; END IF;`
