##  Introduction

_Dynamic Expressions_ are used to obtain values that can depend on session
values. For example they can be used to to filter the records that appear in a
tab by the ones that were created by the user that has logged into the
application.

##  Session values

Depending on how they are defined, there are different kinds of session
values.

It is possible to check (as _System Administrator_ ) all current values loaded
in session in **General Setup || Application || Session Variables** window.

###  Types

####  Session global variables

These values are generated by Java classes and are accessible from anywhere in
the application.

####  Columns

Values for all columns used in a tab are accessible as session variables
within that tab.

Additionally it is also possible to set explicitly a column a session value by
setting its _ Stored in Session  _ attribute. This will make this value
accessible not only for its tab but also for all the tabs in that window.

####  Preferences

_ Preferences  _ allow to define session values. It is possible to define
preferences for a single window or for all of them (leaving blank the window
field) and for one user or for all of them. Preferences are defined in
**General Setup || Application || Preference** window.

When the attribute value matches with a column name, it will be used as
default value for that column overwriting the standard default value for that
column.

Preferences can be defined for a window and user. If no window is selected,
the preference applies globally to the whole application; if one is selected,
it will only be applied in that window. In a similar way, in case the user is
blank, the preference will be shared among all users, other case the
preference will be applied just to the selected user.

For a list of current system preferences see  this  wiki page.

#####  Definition

There are two ways of defining a preference, it can be switched by using the
_Property List_ check field:

  * _Property_ . ( _Property List_ checked). The preference can be taken from a fixed list. It is a  list reference  named _Property Configuration_ . Modules can add new items to this list with the purpose that other modules can set values to them. 
  * _Attribute_ . ( _Property List_ unchecked). The preference is defined by the _Attribute_ field, which is a free text input box. 

#####  Visibility

Preference visibility defines in which cases the preference will be used. It
can be defined at different levels. All of them can be set or left blank, in
case a visibility level is empty, it is not applied so it is visible from any
value of that level; for example if the user parameter is empty, any user will
be able to see that preference. In case the same preference has values at
different levels, it will be used the most specific one. The levels are the
following:

  * _Client_ . Defines the client, if it is empty or _System_ the preference will be visible from any client. 
  * _Organization_ . Defines the visibility from the organization that has been logged in the session. Note that the organization is not the document organization but the one used during the login. So if a role has access to organization A and B, both organization has a value for the same preference and the user logs in the application with that role and organization A, the value defined for that organization will be used, even when creating a document (for example an invoice) in organization B. If it is empty or * it will be visible from all the organizations. Visibility for organizations is calculated taking into account organization tree; this is, if the organization tree looks like A with a child organization A1, preferences defined for A will be visible from A and A1 in case A1 has not a value for them. 
  * _User_ and _Role_ . Which is the user/role that will be able to use the preference. 
  * _Window_ . From which window the preference will be visible. 

#####  Getting/setting preference values

When logging in the application or changing role, preferences visible for that
user/role/client/org are stored in session, that values can be obtained using
the _org.openbravo.erpCommon.utility.Utility.getContext_ method.

Additionally, it is possible to look for the value of a preference querying to
database using the
_org.openbravo.erpCommon.businessUtility.Preferences.getPreferenceValue_
method. This method throws an exception in case the property has not a value
defined visible from the current visibility level (passed as parameters), it
also raises an exception in case of conflict (more than one value defined for
the property at the current visibility level).

Preferences can be set programatically through
_org.openbravo.erpCommon.businessUtility.Preferences.setPreferenceValue_
method.

#####  Conflicts

A conflict for a preference occurs in case the same preference is defined with
different values at the same visibility level. When this happens, one of them
will be stored in session when login in the application or changing the role.
If the preference value is tried to be obtained using
_org.openbravo.erpCommon.businessUtility.Preferences.getPreferenceValue_
method, a _PropertyConflictException_ will be thrown.

Conflicts can be manually resolved by user, checking the _selected_ field of
the preference. In this case the selected value preference will prevail over
the rest.

#####  Modularity

Preferences can be optionally assigned to a module. In this case they will be
exported as part of the module. This makes sense in case it is wanted to
define in a module general settings that will be reused.

####  Auxiliary inputs

_ Auxiliary Inputs  _ are used to create a session value for a concrete tab.
This value can be calculated using a Dynamic Expression and it purpose is to
use it in other Dynamic expressions within the tab it is defined for.

Auxiliary Inputs are defined in **Application Dictionary || Setup || Auxiliary
Input** tab.

###  Accessibility

It is possible that there are different session values types with the same
name that are accessible at the same point, in this case (unless it is
explicitly specified to take the value in a global session value) the value
will be taken following the next approach:

  1. Try to get a preference with the specified name for the current window. 
  2. If no value has been obtained, try to get a value associated to the current window 
  3. If no value has been obtained, look for a global session value. 

##  Syntax and types in Dynamic Expressions

###  Using session values

In Dynamic expressions session values are obtained by their name surrounded by
at symbols (@). Thus to get the content of a session value called _myValue_ ,
it would be done typing _@myValue@_ . Doing it in this manner it would follow
the  accessibility  described above, but it is possible to explicitly obtain
the global value (if exists) not taken into account the other ones, to do so
the value would have a sharp symbol (#) as prefix. In the previous example it
would be _@#myValue@_ .

###  Dynamic expressions types

There are different types for Dynamic Expression, each type can be used
depending on the Application Dictionary object it is defined in. A complete
list of all the objects and which kind of expression can use is defined in the
next section.

The types are:

####  Constant

It can a constant value or a value in stored in session, this type can be used
by all the objects. To set this type no prefix is needed.

Examples:

    
    
    1
    
    
    
    @#AD_User_ID@
    

####  SQL

Some objects accept SQL expressions. This type must have a _@SQL=_ prefix
followed by the SQL clause. It also accepts session values.

Example:

    
    
    @SQL=SELECT DOCSUBTYPESO 
           FROM C_DOCTYPE 
          WHERE C_DOCTYPE_ID = @C_DOCTYPETARGET_ID@
    

####  WhereClause

It is a SQL where clause, in this case it is not necessary to add the _@SQL=_
prefix.

####  Checks

It is used to obtain a boolean value. It does not have any prefix.

Its syntax is Javascript but the comparators are:

  * = instead of == 
  * ! instead of != 
  * & instead of &&
  * | instead of ||
