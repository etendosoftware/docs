#  How to Change Fonts in Etendo Reports
 
!!! example  "IMPORTANT: THIS IS A BETA VERSION"
    It is under active development and may contain **unstable or incomplete features**. Use it **at your own risk**.

##  Overview

This section explains how to **change the fonts** used in Etendo reports. Updating the default fonts can be useful in two main scenarios: enhancing the visual appearance of the reports with more readable or brand-aligned **typography**, or ensuring proper display of **languages** whose characters are not supported by the standard font set, such as Japanese, Arabic, or Vietnamese. Replacing the default fonts with ones that support the required character sets allows the reports to render correctly across different languages.

##  Execution Steps

Etendo uses two different tools to create reports: ???

  * **Jasper Reports**
  * **FOP**

With this, a different approach is needed for each tool to change the **font of the reports** being generated by them. Both approaches will of course be explained here:

###  Changing the font in Jasper Reports

When changing the font in **Jasper Reports** the software [Jaspersoft
Studio](https://community.jaspersoft.com/download-jaspersoft/){target="\_blank"} will be very helpful.

In the above  link, find a detailed tutorial that describes **how to handle** custom fonts in Jaspersoft Studio. In short, these are the steps to carry out:

  * 1\. Get the desired `font's .ttf` file from the pc or from the Internet. 
  * 2\. Create the Font Extension, go to **Preferences window**.

guides/How_to_Change_Fonts_in_Openbravo_Reports-0.png)



  * 3\. Click on `JasperSoft Studio > Fonts`. Click **Add** . At this point provide a unique name for the Font Extension and the path to its extension by selecting the path of the downloaded `.ttf file`. 
  * 4\. Once done, set a PDF Encoding type for the new font in the wizard. 
  * 5\. Change the **fontName** and **pdfFontName** used in the text fields wanted to have being displayed with the new font in our report. Accomplish that by either using Jaspersoft Studio or making changes directly in the `.jrxml` file using a text editor. 
  * 6\. And, for the document(s), do not forget to to choose the same PDF Encoding type as the one set for the font in step 4. 
  * 7\. Export the font into a `.jar` file. Once again, Jaspersoft Studio can lend us a hand with doing this: Go to `JasperSoft Studio > Fonts` and this time click **Export** . Select the font and export it into a `.jar file`. 
  * 8\. Create a new module to keep the `.jar` file. Inside the module folder, create a subfolder `/lib/runtime` and put the exported `.jar` file in there.

  * 9\. Stop tomcat.
  * 10\. Execute: 
    
        `ant smartbuild`

  * 11\. Restart tomcat. 

###  Changing the font in FOP Reports

Not every report in Etendo is designed as a `.jrxml` report. For example, the **Price List Report** is generated using **FOP**. The approach to change the font in this kind of reports is different; there is no need to change the report definition but make use of the **FOP configuration file**. These are the steps to follow:

  1. Get the desired font's `.ttf` file from the system or download it from the Internet. For example: `DejaVuSans.ttf`.

  2. The `.fo reports` used in Etendo use the **Helvetica** font by default. To replace this font with the new one, modify the `config/userconfig.xml` file as explained  here. So, just add this new `xml`source snippet inside the ** <configuration> ** tags of the **userconfig.xml** file: 
    
        <fonts>
    <renderers>
      <renderer mime="application/pdf">
       <fonts>
         <font embed-url="/home/openbravo/DejaVuSans.ttf" kerning="yes"> 
           <font-triplet name="Helvetica" style="normal" weight="normal"/> 
           <font-triplet name="Helvetica" style="normal" weight="bold"/> 
           <font-triplet name="Helvetica" style="italic" weight="normal"/> 
           <font-triplet name="Helvetica" style="italic" weight="bold"/>
          </font> 
        </fonts>
      </renderer>
    </renderers>

Note that in this case the font has been placed in the path: `/home/openbravo`. ???


  3. Execute: 
    
        `ant smartbuild`

  4. Restart tomcat 

After this change, all `.fo reports` in the application will use the **DejaVuSans** font instead of Helvetica.

##  Result

The following screenshots show the results after successfully carrying out the steps mentioned above:

First, we have a **Jasper Report** where the font of the title has been replaced with another font:

And last, we have a **FOP Report** with the default font replaced:
