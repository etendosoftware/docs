##  Preparing development environment

First of all you need to install and configure different components of the
Openbravo environment as it's described in  Custom Installation  guide. In
order to comply to development requirements some of those components have to
be additionally adjusted according to  Development Stack Setup  .

![](/assets/developer-guide/etendo-classic/how-to-guides/Bulbgraph.png){: .legacy-image-style} |
**Double check** that you have read and followed the  Development Stack Setup
article  
---|---  
  
After completing all of the steps in the aforementioned guides, please make
sure that:

  * Your OS user has read/write access to your tomcat installation home directory (CATALINA_BASE). 
  * Environment variables (e.g. ANT_OPTS, CATALINA_OPTS, JAVA_HOME, ANT_OPTS, etc) are declared in the proper categories (i.e. System/User variables) (windows only) 
  * You have downloaded the  latest **Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers** release  . 

##  Download source code

The source code can be checked out using any **Mercurial** client. There is no
any restrictions on the read access so you wouldn't need any credentials to
access the repository. The detailed procedure of the source code check out is
described in  Mercurial Manual for Openbravo Developers  . As it's explained
in the guide it's normally considered as a good practice to have a _pristine_
clone and _working_ one, so we would strongly encourage you to follow that
'rule'. It is also highly advisable to clone the repository into a destination
directory which is outside of Eclipse workspace.

If you want to build the latest stable release:

    
    
    $ hg clone https://code.openbravo.com/erp/devel/main openbravo
    $ cd openbravo
    $ hg up 3.0PR23Q4

For Openbravo developers, you should work with the **pi** repository:

    
    
    hg clone https://code.openbravo.com/erp/devel/pi
    $ cd pi

##  Openbravo installation

The Openbravo installation is performed in several steps.

###  Configure the properties

So, first of all you have to configure the Openbravo by specifying some
general properties, e.g. Tomcat installation directory, database connection
details, etc. This can (and in fact **must** ) be done via a console
application which has to be compile first. For that, go to the directory with
the working clone of the repository and execute:

    
    
    ant setup

The invocation of this ant target will compile and execute automatically a
console application.By going through the console application provide all
requested information and at the end, select ` Accept ` to apply the changes
and close the application.

**Note:** More about setup ant task can be found at
Openbravo.properties#Edition  .

As a result of these actions a new file ` Openbravo.properties ` , containing
specified settings, will be created in config subdirectory.

![](/assets/developer-guide/etendo-classic/how-to-guides/Bulbgraph.png){: .legacy-image-style} |
While going through the console application, DO NOT change the _default
context name_ which is openbravo. This guide assumes that it will be left this
way.  
---|---  
  
More about the properties can be found at  Openbravo.properties  . Now the
Openbravo is ready to be installed.

###  Install from sources

In order to install the Openbravo three main procedures have to be
accomplished:

  * the Openbravo database has to be created and populated with some initial values 
  * sources have to be generated 
  * all sources have to compiled to binaries which later can be executed on a WEB server (Tomcat). 

All this is done by invoking from the root of the working clone
(XXX\opensource\openbravo\erp\devel\main\\).

    
    
    ant install.source

This process can take quite long time (up to 25 min) depending on hardware
configuration. It's always a good idea to redirect the output of the task
execution to a log file which then can be analyzed or sent to the support team
in case of problems. After the task has completed the log **should not**
contain any error or exception massages as well as it **should** have ` BUILD
SUCCESSFUL ` message at the end of the file. (if you are under Linux use `
grep ` command to check whether the file contains any exceptions). After
successful installation the next step can be taken - importing to Eclipse IDE.

![](/assets/developer-guide/etendo-classic/how-to-guides/Bulbgraph.png){: .legacy-image-style} |  You
can save the install.source log using  tee  in Linux or  mtee  in Windows  
---|---  
  
###  Problems running install.source

If you find problems running install.source, check the
Installation/Troubleshooting  article

##  Import into Eclipse IDE

Launch Eclipse.

![](/assets/developer-guide/etendo-classic/how-to-guides/Bulbgraph.png){: .legacy-image-style} |
After Eclipse has started go to _Project_ menu and **disable** _Build
Automatically_ option there.  
---|---  
  
Now 4 projects need to be imported in the workspace (by menu _File_ =>
_Import_ and then _General_ => _Existing Projects into Workspace_ ). Here they
are:

    
    
    openbravo        XXX\opensource\openbravo\erp\devel\main\
    OpenbravoCore    XXX\opensource\openbravo\erp\devel\main\src-core
    OpenbravoTrl     XXX\opensource\openbravo\erp\devel\main\src-trl
    OpenbravoWAD     XXX\opensource\openbravo\erp\devel\main\src-wad
    

##  Create the Tomcat Server

Then open _Servers_ view and create a new instance of Tomcat server:

![](/assets/developer-guide/etendo-classic/how-to-
guides/How_to_setup_Eclipse_IDE-4.png){: .legacy-image-style}

While going through the wizard select ` openbravo ` and add it to ` configured
` resources. Then click "Finish". The created instance should appear in the
view. Double click on it to change its settings in the form depicted on the
picture below:

![](/assets/developer-guide/etendo-classic/how-to-
guides/How_to_setup_Eclipse_IDE-5.png){: .legacy-image-style}

  * In **Server options**
    * check the **Serve modules without publishing** . See  here  for additional information. 
  * In **Timeouts**
    * set **Start** and **Stop** timeouts to 120 seconds 
  * In the **Modules** tab 
    * edit openbravo module and uncheck the "Auto reloading enabled" flag. 

###  Change VM arguments settings

  * In **General Information**
    * click on **Open launch configuration** link 
    * switch to **Arguments** tab 
    * add the following line at the end of **VM arguments** input: 

    
    
     -server -Djava.awt.headless=true -Xms384M -Xmx1536M -XX:MaxPermSize=256M 

After changing all, save your server configuration (press Ctrl+S).

###  Renaming server

When creating a new server, by default is is named "Tomcat v7.0 Server at
localhost". This name can be changed to something custom, both at creation
time or later by editing it in server window.

In this case, it is necessary to bind the Server Library with the actual
server. To do so:

  * In Project Explorer view, right click on openbravo project and select Properties. 
  * Select Java Build Path left menu item. 
  * Select Libraries tab, there you should see Server library is marked as unbound. 
  * Click Edit button. 
  * Select your server. 

![](/assets/developer-guide/etendo-classic/how-to-
guides/How_to_setup_Eclipse_IDE-6.png){: .legacy-image-style}

###  Serve modules without publishing option

This server option allows to serve web applications directly from the
directory structure of the development workspace. This allows, among others,
to deploy the application in Eclipse in a faster way.

##  Import Preferences

The next step is to set the standard preferences used in the development of
Openbravo.

  * The preference file is located in the ` openbravo/config/eclipse ` folder in the development project 
  * Import workspace preferences clicking on _File > Import _ , then select _General > Preferences _ and click on _Next_ button. 

![](/assets/developer-guide/etendo-classic/how-to-
guides/How_to_setup_Eclipse_IDE-7.png){: .legacy-image-style}

  * Browse to ` openbravo/config/eclipse/Openbravo-eclipse-prefs.epf ` file, select Import all radio button and click on **Finish** button. 

![](/assets/developer-guide/etendo-classic/how-to-
guides/How_to_setup_Eclipse_IDE-8.png){: .legacy-image-style}

Once finished, select all the projects, refresh them, and rebuild them (right
click on one or more projects and you will find the Refresh and the Rebuild
options). You should not get warnings nor errors.

![](/assets/developer-guide/etendo-classic/how-to-guides/Bulbgraph.png){: .legacy-image-style} |
When working with releases older than **3.0PR19Q2** , it is necessary to
install  Eclipse Luna Formatter  in order to keep proper formatting.  
---|---  
  
##  Configure the Logger

In order to be able to see the logs in the console of the server, follow the
next guide  How_To_Configure_Log

##  Launch from Eclipse

Now start the Tomcat server by right-clicking on the server instance in the
_Servers_ view and choosing _Start_ option in the popup menu. Wait until the
server is started (can take up to 2 minutes) and visit
http://localhost:8080/openbravo/  in your internet browser. If everything was
configured and installed properly you will get to the Openbravo ERP log in
page. Use these credentials to log in:

  * username - Openbravo 
  * password - openbravo 

both are **case sensitive** .

That's it, the installation is over and you're ready to start developing.

![](/assets/developer-guide/etendo-classic/how-to-guides/Bulbgraph.png){: .legacy-image-style} |  If
your system has enough resources (memory/processor) then you can try enabling
the _Build Automatically_ option in the _Project_ menu. Enabling it will give
you direct feedback while developing.  
---|---  
  
##  Upgrading old workspaces to >=PR17Q1

Starting from  PR17Q1  , the minimum  System Requirements  for Openbravo were
increased to Java 7 and Tomcat 7. For worskpaces created in older versions,
some upgrade might be required.

  * JDK >=7 and Tomcat >= 7 need to be installed in the system 
  * Eclipse must be at least in  Indigo release  , though latest version is recommended 

Once updated to a newer version on a recent stack, it will be automatically
allowed to write Java 7 compliant code.

If Tomcat 6 was used, the server needs to be removed and a new Tomcat >=7
needs to be created, after it, a rebuild will be required, see  how here  .

  

![](/assets/developer-guide/etendo-classic/how-to-
guides/How_to_setup_Eclipse_IDE-11.png){: .legacy-image-style} |  If you are developing modules
compatible with older Openbravo versions or creating code to be backported to
those, the code needs to be still compatible with Java 6. In these cases it is
recommended to use workspace with older (previous to 3.0PR17Q1) Openbravo
sources.  
---|---  
  
##  Upgrading old workspaces to >=PR18Q4

Starting from  PR18Q4  , the minimum  JDK  required for Openbravo was
increased to Java 8. For worskpaces created in older versions, some upgrade
might be required.

  * JDK >=8 need to be installed in the system 
  * Eclipse must be at least in  Luna release  , though latest version is recommended 

Once updated to a newer version on a recent stack, it will be automatically
allowed to write Java 8 compliant code.

![](/assets/developer-guide/etendo-classic/how-to-
guides/How_to_setup_Eclipse_IDE-12.png){: .legacy-image-style} |  If you are developing modules
compatible with older Openbravo versions or creating code to be backported to
those, the code needs to be still compatible with Java 7. In these cases it is
recommended to use workspace with older (previous to 3.0PR18Q4) Openbravo
sources.  
---|---  
  
##  Upgrading old workspaces to >=PR19Q2

Starting from  PR19Q2  sources formatting changed, check
How_to_Migrate_Sources_Format  for more details.
