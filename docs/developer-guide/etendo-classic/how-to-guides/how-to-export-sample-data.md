# How to Export Sample Data

## Overview

The objective of this document is to explain how the Etendo sample data is exported using the `export.sample.data` task.

## Sample Data Dataset

The tables that will be exported when the `export.sample.data` task is run are included in the Client Definition dataset. You can read more about datasets in [Datasets](../concepts/Datasets.md).

!!!note 
    The way the `export.sample.data` task currently works, the SQL Where Clause defined in the dataset tables of the Client Definition dataset will be ignored and replaced by a client filter.

## Exporting the Sample Data

To export the sample data of a given client, this `export.sample.data` gradle task, available from the Etendo root folder must be run. It has the following parameters:

  * Client: The name of the client whose sample data will be exported.
  * Module: The module where the sample.data will be exported. The exported sample data will be stored in the referencedata/sampledata/clientName folder relative to the module path. To export to the core sample data folder, 'org.openbravo' must be specified in the client parameter.
  * ExportFormat (optional): It is used to specify the export format of the sample data. Currently there are two available export formats: xml (the default one) and copy. The copy export format will be only available when exporting the sample data from a PostgreSQL database. Sample data exported with the copy format can only be imported in PostgreSQL databases. If the copy parameter is used in an Oracle environment, a warning message will be shown and the xml format will be used instead.

For instance, to export the sample data of the 'F&B International Group' client to core using the COPY format, the following command must be used:

```bash title="Terminal"
./gradlew export.sample.data -Dclient="F&B International Group" -Dmodule=org.openbravo -DexportFormat=copy
```
