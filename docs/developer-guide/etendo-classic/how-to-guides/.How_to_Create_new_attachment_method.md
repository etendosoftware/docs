#  How to Create new attachment method

##  Introduction

Note that this how to is developers focused. It describes how to implement a
new attachment method that integrates any CMS or ECM with Openbravo.

##  Attachment Method window

As system administrator the new _Attachment Method_ must be created in that
window. The _Search Key_ is used to identify the Java class implementing the
method.

##  AttachImplementation class

The class that implements the attachment method must implement the
_AttachImplementation_ abstract class. This class defines some methods that
must be implemented to have a fully functional attachment method.

The class must have a qualifier to identify it. The name must be the search
key set in the Attachment Method window. It has to follow this structure:

    
    
     @ComponentProvider.Qualifier("CMSSearchKey")

.

Don't use _Default_ qualifier as it is the one used by Core's default
attachment method.

Once the implementation have been developed, the following guide could be used
to  configure an attachment method  .

    
    
    Â 
     /**
      * Public class to allow extend the functionality
      */

        * @param parameters
