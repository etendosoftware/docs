title: How to Use Secure Webservices

## Overview

This module allows calling any standard Etendo web service in the same way as calling the "/ws" endpoint, but using token authentication.

This authentication method also allows defining the context for the calls by choosing the role and/or organization when requesting a token. It is also possible to renew a token to refresh the expiration date or change the role/organization.

Besides the new authentication implementation, the module includes utilities for developers and useful web services, such as jsonDal (to access the OB Data Access Layer with json).
