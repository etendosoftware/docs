##  How to add a constraint

The generic documentation about Constraints in Openbravo can be found  here  .

###  Objective

The HowTo on  How to add Columns to a Table  added a new _valid to_ column to
the _ht_salary_ table.

Logically the _valid to_ date should always be after (or identical) to the
_valid from_ date. Enforcement of this logical restriction is possible with a
database constraint which is a _SQL-Expression_ which check if the data is
valid on all modification done to the data in this table.

###  Modularity

The changes described in this Howto are done will all be part of the module
with the dbprefix **HT2** so will be placed in the same module which added the
_valid to_ column in the first place.

As the constraint will be placed in the module with dbprefix **HT2** as just
explained but the table _ht_salary_ is defined in another module **HT** the
constraint name must follow the usual rule and start with **EM_HT2_** .

If the constraint would be added in the same module as its table, then this
EM_ naming-rule would not be needed. However best practice is to let it start
with the full tablename in that case to ensure its name will be unique across
the database.}}

Remember that in all cases the full constraint-name (like any other db-object
name) is not allowed to be longer then 30 characters.

###  Add constraint to database

To add the constraint execute in database the following clause:

**PostgreSQL**

    
    
     
    ALTER TABLE ht_salary ADD constraint em_ht2_ht_salary_date_chk CHECK (em_ht2_validto>=validfrom);

**Oracle**

    
    
     
    ALTER TABLE HT_SALARY ADD CONSTRAINT EM_HT2_HT_SALARY_DATES_CHK CHECK  (VALIDTO>=VALIDFROM) ENABLE;

Adding an **unique constraint** to an existing module is considered as an API
change and could affect to existing environments already populated. Before
adding it evaluate the risk and consider creating a  a buildvalidation  to
check if the existing data complies. If it does not the buildvalidation can
stop the update process and give a proper message.  
---|---  
  
###  Adding a proper message

Now when editing data in the _Employee Salary || Salary_ tab and trying to use
a _Valid to_ date lying before the _Valid from_ date we get an error message
like shown below.

However this error message isn't too useful yet for the user as it does not
indicate at all why the save action was not done.

guides/How_to_add_a_Constraint-2.png){: .legacy-image-style}

  
It would be better it said something like _"The Valid To date cannot be before
the Valid From date"_ to help the user to specify the two dates correctly.
This is done adding a new  Message  . This leverage the Openbravo translation
system so the message can be translated and shown in a users language.

Details on how to create a new Message entry can be found  here  .

As a short summary:

In the **Application Dictionary || Message** window create a new record using
the following details:

  * **Module** _Openbravo Howtos 2_ as this is the module containing the constraint also. 
  * **Search key** : The search key must be exactly the same as the constraint's one, in this case _em_ht2_ht_salary_dates_chk_ as this is the link between the constraint and the message. 

  * **Message type** : Depending on the type the UI for the message box will be different (green for success, yellow for warning...), in our case we want a red error message box, so we select _Error_ . 
  * **Message text** : It is the user friendly message that will be displayed inside the message box. So let's enter: _The Valid To date may not be before the Valid From date_ . 

That's all now we have a message like:

guides/How_to_add_a_Constraint-3.png){: .legacy-image-style}

###  Export database

Whenever Application Dictionary or Physical database is modified, it is
possible to export that information to xml files, this is the way Openbravo
ERP maintains database data as part of its source code files. To do it just
execute:

    
    
     ant export.database
