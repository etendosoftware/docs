#  Introduction

Starting from **PR19Q3** , Openbravo uses Prettier as JavaScript formatter and
ESLint as linting tool (  more details  ). Among its advantages, both are
supported by most modern IDEs, so they can be configured to check linting as
you code and properly format files when saving.

#  Eclipse

There is no known plugins to add support for ESLint or Prettier. However,
built in Openbravo scripts can still be used.

#  Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code supports both ESLint and Prettier via extensions. Please,
install the extensions shown in the screenshot below:

guides/How_To_Setup_ESLint_And_Prettier_In_Your_IDE-0.png){: .legacy-image-style}

Then, make sure you run _npm ci_ on your Openbravo root folder to install the
tools before using it in your IDE.

To access settings.json press Ctrl + Shift + P in VSCode, then search
Preferences: Open Settings (JSON).

guides/How_To_Setup_ESLint_And_Prettier_In_Your_IDE-1.png){: .legacy-image-style}

For **Prettier** , in order to use our config file to format, the following
option should be enabled: "Prettier: Require Config", or in settings.json:

    
    
    {
    ...
      "prettier.requireConfig": true,
    ...
    }

In addition, add the following line in settings.json to enable autoformatting
of file when saving the file:

    
    
    {
    ...
       "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    ...
    }

#  IntelliJ

IntelliJ Ultimate has built-in support of ESLint and supports Prettier via
Plugin.

  * **ESLint** : In Settings, enable ESLint and define the Node interpreter and ESLint package locations.

guides/How_To_Setup_ESLint_And_Prettier_In_Your_IDE-2.png){: .legacy-image-style}

  * **Prettier** : Install the JetBrains's Prettier plugin and in the Settings screen, just define the location of the Node interpreter and the Prettier package. Then you can format the file using Prettier with Ctrl+Alt+Shift+P or the context menu.

#  Sublime Text

**ESLint** just works by installing SublimeLinter and then SublimeLinter-
eslint packages using PackageControl.

**Prettier** can be used by installing the package JsPrettier in
PackageControl. By default, this plugin will search for the Prettier CLI in
the following order:

  * Locally installed prettier, relative to the Sublime Text Project file's root directory. 
  * User's home directory 
  * JsPrettier Sublime Text plug-in directory 
  * Globally installed prettier 

If none applies, it is required to introduce the path of the Prettier CLI in
JsPrettier settings (Preferences|Package Settings|JsPrettier):

    
    
    {
    ...
      "prettier_cli_path": "<path_to_prettier_executable>"
    ...
    }

#  Atom

Atom supports both ESLint and Prettier via packages.
