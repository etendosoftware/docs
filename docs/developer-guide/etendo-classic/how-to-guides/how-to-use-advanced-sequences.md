## Sequences

### Overview

This document covers how to use the implementation of sequences, explain all the features, and give some implementation example cases.

There are two base reference implementations defined that you can use or extend:

- Transactional Sequences: These sequences lock the table in the database to guarantee  the generation of identifiers sequentially and avoid duplicates or gaps.
- Non-Transactional Sequences: In this case, the process to create sequences uses Database Sequences and should be used in cases where the gaps between numbers is not an issue.

### Quick sequence setup

1. First, log-in as “System administrator”. Open the `Application` > `Application Dictionary ` >`Tables and Columns` Select the Column that you want to set as a sequence and change the Reference field to Transactional Sequence or non-Transactional sequence.

> _If you want to define a new sequence reference, you must add it in **Reference Search Key** field and the parent (Base Sequence) must be in the **Reference** field.
!!! info
    See how to create a new reference [here](/docs/legacy/technical-documentation/etendo-environment/platform/sequences#new-sequence-reference)_

| _Example: Adding transactional sequence in the invoice table_ |

2. Then, it is necessary to run a process in `Application` > `General Setup`\> `Application`\> `Create Sequences` to generate the sequences, selecting the root Organization where they will be created.

!!! warning
    To run this process, the user must be logged using the role which manages the sequence, not as system administrator.

> This process will only generate the combinations for organization and document types, in case you want to generate sequences for the new dimensions described below, you must extend the `SequencesGenerator` action and overwrite the `generateSequenceCombination` and `setSequenceValues` methods in order to generate the relevant combinations and set the newly added dimensions.
!!! warning
    You can also create the required sequences manually.

After that, in the `Document Sequence` window you can see the sequences generated.

| _List of sequences generated by the process_ |

When you edit the record, you can see:

![formviewad_sequence.png](/docs/assets/legacy/technicaldocumentation/platform/formviewad_sequence.png)

| _Sequence form view_ |

- **Organization:** Owner organization associated to the sequence.
- **Name:** An identifier using the Table and Column associated to the sequence.
- **Description:** Field to add information or details about the sequence.
- **Auto Numbering:**  Check to define the increment and initial numbering.
- **Increment By:** Numeric Value to define the sequence increment.
- **Next Assigned Number:** Initial sequence number.
- **Prefix:** String at the beginning of the sequence  **(**Supports masking**).**
- **Suffix:** String at the end of the sequence  **(**Supports masking**).**
- **Document Type :** In case that the table has document types, a sequence for each document type will have been created.
- **Mask:** It is a string defining a parse format, with the possibility to define a dynamic date or literal substring, in addition to the formatted incremental number. For more information about masking see [Sequences Masking](/docs/legacy/financial-management-setup-accounting#sequence-masking)
- **Table:** Defines the table in which the sequence type column is located.
- **Column:** The column where the sequence is defined.

3. In case the sequence is applied in DocumentNo field, the user has to ensure that the Document Type associated has the property `sequenced document` unchequed to avoid throwing the legacy process. To do that, first log in as a user, then open `Aplication>Finantial Management>Accounting>Setup>Document Type`, select the Document Type associated and finally, edit it.
   
!!! warning
    _If the step is not followed, the legacy process will be run._

4. Finally, you must compile the application. Run `./gradlew compile.complete smartbuild`.

5. To export the changes to your module, do not forget to do a `./gradlew export.database`.

### **New sequence reference**

If you want to define a new reference with transactional or non-transactional parent reference, you must create a new record in the Reference window (`Application` > `Application Dictionary ` >`Reference`) and set:

![new_sequence_reference.png](/docs/assets/legacy/technicaldocumentation/platform/new_sequence_reference.png)

| _New sequence reference example_ |

- **Name:** New reference identifier.
- **Description:** Field to add information or details about the reference.
- **Parent Reference:** Select transactional or non-transactional sequence.

#### Sequence Config tab: 

![sequence_config.png](/docs/assets/legacy/technicaldocumentation/platform/sequence_config.png)

- **Generator Java Class:** Class that generate the next sequence value using the document sequence definitions. (If it is empty, a default generator is used ).

When creating a non-transactional sequence, you must define:

- **DB Sequence Name:** Name of the sequence defined in Data Base.
- **DB Sequence Initial Value**: Initial sequence number.
- **DB Sequence Increment Value:** Numeric Value to define the sequence increment.

You can use a defined Sequence or create a new one using SQL:

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE [ IF NOT EXISTS ] sequence_name
    [ AS { SMALLINT | INT | BIGINT } ]
    [ INCREMENT [ BY ] increment ]
    [ MINVALUE minvalue | NO MINVALUE ]
    [ MAXVALUE maxvalue | NO MAXVALUE ]
    [ START [ WITH ] start ]
    [ CACHE cache ]
    [ [ NO ] CYCLE ]
    [ OWNED BY { table_name.column_name | NONE } ]
```

| _Postgres syntax to create a new sequence_ |

!!! info
    In case the parent is Transactional Sequence only the Generator Java Class field will appear, but in case of the parent being a Non-Transactional Sequence you must define all the fiels.

&nbsp;

#### Dimension List

A Dimension is a new filter clause used to select the sequence to be used when creating or saving a new record. The default dimensions are:

- Client
- Organization
- Document Type

This way you can have two different sequences depending on the Organization of the record, for example. The same applies to the other default dimensions.

!!! info
    Dimensions are currently supported only in **Transactional Sequences**.

![dimension_graph1.png](/docs/assets/legacy/technicaldocumentation/platform/dimension_graph1.png)

&nbsp;

##### Adding custom dimensions

If you want to add a new dimension to filter sequences, this dimension should be a column in both tables `AD_Sequence` and the table where the transactional sequence is used. You must also create a new reference, and create a new record in the `Dimension List` tab with this column (see how to create a new sequence reference above).

&nbsp;

- ##### When a dimension is a foreign key column

1. To define a new dimension, you have to start adding a column in the `AD_Sequence` table, and a Foreign Key to the referenced column in an specific table. The dimension column must be created in the corresponding table (`M_Product` in this example) unless you decide to use an existing column as dimension.

!!! warning
    The name of the columns must be the same in both tables.

```sql
ALTER TABLE AD_Sequence ADD COLUMN <dimension>_id varchar(32),
ADD CONSTRAINT ad_sequence_<dimension> FOREIGN KEY (<dimension>_id) REFERENCES <table> (<dimension>_id)

ALTER TABLE M_Product ADD COLUMN <dimension>_id varchar(32),
ADD CONSTRAINT M_product_<dimension> FOREIGN KEY (<dimension>_id) REFERENCES <table> (<dimension>_id)
```

| _Remember to replace `<dimension>` with your desired name_ |

2. Then you have to create the corresponding `AD_Column` register in the Application Dictionary. `Application` > `Application Dictionary ` > `Tables and Columns` search the `AD_Sequence` Table and create the new column.
   Then you must set the `Reference` field of the dimension pointing to the foreign key table.

!!! warning
    If the table with the dimension records is a new table, it should be created in `Application` > `Application Dictionary ` >`Reference`, setting the Base Reference as Table, and adding the table in the `Table Reference` tab.

3.  Also, you have to create the field in the `Document Sequence` window. `Application` > `Application Dictionary ` >`Windows, Tabs and Fields` search `Document Sequence` window and in `Sequence` Tab run the process to create the new field.

4.  If the dimension is a new column, you must to repeat the previous step to create the field in the table where the sequence is used.

5.  Finally, go back to your Reference created previously and create a new register in the `Dimension List` tab, selecting the new column you just created, then execute a ` ./gradlew smartbuild`

&nbsp;

- ##### When a dimension is a List

1. First, you have to create a new column in AD_Sequence table to reference a list and do the same in the table which uses the sequence. The other option is to use an existing one.

!!! warning
    The name of the columns must be the same in both tables.

```
ALTER TABLE public.ad_sequence
ADD COLUMN <list_name> character varying(60);

ALTER TABLE public.m_product
ADD COLUMN <list_name> character varying(60);

```

| _An example with the table m_product. (Remember to replace `<list_name>` with your desired name)_ |

2. Then, you have to create the column in the `Application` > `Application Dictionary ` >`Tables and Columns` search `AD_Sequence` Table and create the new column.
   You must set the `Reference` field of the new Column to `List` and indicate the corresponding Reference Search Key (Or define a new one). In the Default field you can set the id of one of the list elements and when a new Sequence is created, the reference automatically will be set.
   You also have to do the same in the table that uses the sequence, or you can use an existing one.

3. Finally, go back to your Refrence previously created and create a new register in the `Dimension List` tab by selecting the new column you have just created then, execute a ` ./gradlew smartbuild`.
   &nbsp;

##### Change sequence when change dimension

- If you want the sequence to change automatically when you change the dimension or the configured list, you must implement a callback or extend it if it already exists.
  The following example explains how to implement the callout, taking into account that the dimension used is the Product Category and that the order is automatically entered in the Search Key field.

```java
public class ChangeSequenceAfterChangeProductCategory extends SimpleCallout {
  @Override
  protected void execute(SimpleCallout.CalloutInfo info) throws ServletException {
    final String strcProductId = info.vars.getStringParameter("inpmProductId");

    if (StringUtils.isBlank(strcProductId)) {
      try {
        OBContext.setAdminMode();
        Tab tab = OBDal.getInstance().get(Tab.class,info.getTabId());
        Field field = tab.getADFieldList()
        .stream()
        .filter(f -> ("inp" + Sqlc.TransformaNombreColumna(f.getColumn().getDBColumnName())).equals("inpvalue"))
        .findFirst()
        .orElse(null);
        String sequenceNumber = Utilities.getDocumentNo(field);
        info.addResult("inpvalue", "<" + sequenceNumber + ">");
      } finally {
        OBContext.restorePreviousMode();
      }
    }
  }
}
```
