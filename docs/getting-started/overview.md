# What is an ERP?

Welcome to the first step in understanding **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)** systems—powerful tools that are at the heart of modern business management.

This section helps you grasp what an ERP is, how it works, and why it’s essential for organizations of all sizes.

An **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)** system is a comprehensive software solution that integrates and optimizes an organization’s key processes in a single, unified platform. It connects departments, streamlines workflows, and gives leaders real-time insights to make informed decisions.
