#### Icon references

There are different types of menu items which are identified with different icons:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ![](../../assets/drive/1apop_xv-FUNdRrbFRKYftecCOtoNPBsW.png ) | Folders are used to organize other items within them. They can be expanded or collapsed to show their contents by clicking them. |
| ![](../../assets/drive/1NRP6x7Skj7LAT4mVS3QtloWPHncJGIQD.png) | Reports explode information from Etendo Classic. |
| ![](../../assets/drive/19YyKApp-ccjaq7vy_2NkpEtEOimOU1jW.png) | Processes allow complex operations to be performed. Some examples would be to import data from a file or the automatic creation of invoices from purchase orders. |
| ![](../../assets/drive/1uO4tHOiBKtbZC9303O3-we-NWVlYLgQx.png) | Windows allow the user to create, modify or query records. By records, it is meant any entity that has its own data within Etendo Classic, such as a product, an order, an invoice, etc. |

## Application Areas 

Etendo is split into different application areas. Each area is represented by a separate folder accessible from the Application menu in **the top navigation** screen area.

### Window structure

The Toolbar contains action buttons and process buttons. Action buttons are generic and can be applied to almost all selected records.  Process buttons are record specific and depend on the record status and the active level (header or lines or lower).
