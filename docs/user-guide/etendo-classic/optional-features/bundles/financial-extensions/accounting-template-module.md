# Accounting Template Module

:octicons-package-16: Javapackage: `com.etendoerp.accounting.templates`

## Overview

The Accounting Template Module allows setting a **non deductible tax's amount** to a specified financial account. This functionality only applies to **purchase invoices**. 
By default, the accounting amount that is generated in the supplier invoices when a non-deductible tax range is used, is assigned to the accounting expense account configured in the **Accounting** tab of the product. This module allows setting a non deductible tax's amount to a specified financial account., it is possible to post the non-deductible tax amount to a specific account defined directly in the **Tax Rate configuration**. This provides more control and allows better separation between product expenses and tax expenses. To do this, check the **Use the configured account** checkbox located inside the **Accounting** tab in the **Tax rate** window.
