# Bulk Completion

:octicons-package-16: Javapackage: `com.etendoerp.bulk.completion` 

## Overview

This section describes the Bulk Completion module included in the Etendo Financial Extensions bundle.

!!! info
    To be able to include this functionality, the Financial Extensions Bundle must be installed. To do that, follow the instructions from the marketplace: [Essentials Extensions Bundle](https://marketplace.etendo.cloud/#/product-details?module=39AC2D9F72124AC7A1D0A3D005293C9E){target="_blank"}. For more information about the available versions, core compatibility and new features, visit [Essentials Extensions - Release notes](../../../../../whats-new/release-notes/etendo-classic/bundles/essentials-extensions/release-notes.md).

!!! warning
    Before using this functionality, remember that processing multiple records at the same time can affect system performance, especially when handling a large volume of data.

The Bulk Completion functionality allows the user to complete, reactivate or close multiple records by selecting them and clicking the **Bulk completion** button. This makes records management easier and more efficient, reducing the time spent processing individual records.

As seen here, you can select multiple records at the same time, drafts in this case, and click the Bulk completion button to complete them all at once.
