# Business Partner Tax Category

:material-menu: `Application` > `Financial Management` > `Accounting` > `Setup` > `Business Partner Tax Category`

## Overview

A business partner tax category allows the user to group and manage similar business partners tax rates.

Not all the business partners are subject to the same type of tax, that depends on the business partner activity type, for instance:

-   there could be business partners subject just to VAT (Value Added Tax)
-   and there could be business partners subject to VAT and to Income Tax

and even business partners subject to the same tax type could be tax-exempt or not depending on the type of activity they perform.

Business Partner tax categories allow the user to group similar taxes, and the same business partner tax category can be assigned to more than one business partner.

A business partner may or may not be linked to a business partner tax category:

-   if a business partner is linked to a business partner tax category, only the tax rate/s which belongs to that business partner tax category will be used to **automatically** populate the applicable tax rate in an order/invoice line.

There are other variables which can reduce up to just "one" the tax rate automatically populated in an order/invoice line, while entering a business partner and a product in an order/invoice.

Those variables are related to the tax category as well as the way each tax rate is configured.

!!! info
    It is important to notice that all available tax rates are available for *manual* selection in an order/invoice line regardless a tax rate is automatically populated by Etendo for that given order/invoice line.

The end-user could need to select a particular tax rate under a given business scenario that is not the common one.

### Business Partner Tax Category

It is possible to create as many business partners categories as required to be later on linked to the corresponding tax rates and business partners, if applicable.

Once created, the business partner tax categories must be linked to the corresponding business partners, if applicable, in either:

-   the Customer tab of the Business Partner window.
-   and/or the Vendor/Creditor tab of the Business Partner window.
