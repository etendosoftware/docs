# G/L Category

:material-menu: `Application` > `Financial Management` > `Accounting` > `Setup` > `G/L Category`

## Overview

In this window, the user can create and manage G/L Categories to be used in the General Ledger. The G/L Category defines optional identifiers for a document or journal. Each Category may be used on a document, import or manual journal. These categories **help organize and report ledger lines across journals**.

Fields to note:

- **Client**: The client this category belongs to.
- **Organization**: The organization that will use the category.
- **Name**: A descriptive identifier (that does need to be unique) of a record/document that is used as a default search option along with the search key (that is unique). It is up to 60 characters in length.
- **Description**: Additional information about the category.
- **Active**: A flag indicating whether this record is available for use or deactivated.

    !!!info
        It is possible to deactivate categories you no longer want users to pick; existing postings remain unchanged.

- **Category Type**: It indicates the source of the journal for this category. Journals can be generated from a document, entered manually or imported.
- **Default**: When checked, this category is selected by default for new records. This option speeds up data entry when necessary.

### Example

After filling the fields and saving, your category will be available for use in journal entries, imports, and document processing.
