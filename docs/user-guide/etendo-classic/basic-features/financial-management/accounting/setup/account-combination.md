## Overview

An account combination is an Organization's General Ledger account.

### Combination

The Account Combination window allows the user to review the Organization's General Ledger accounts.

The accounts can not be created manually in this window, but in the Account Tree window.

Every time that an account (or subaccount in Etendo terms) is created in an account tree of a General Ledger, the corresponding account combination is also created in this window.

The account combination window shows the data below:

-   the *General Ledger*
-   the *Organization*
-   and the *Account*
