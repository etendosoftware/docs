# ABC Activity

:material-menu: `Application` > `Financial Management` > `Accounting` > `Setup` > `ABC Activity`

## Overview

ABC Activity is part of **Etendo’s Activity-Based Costing (ABC)** functionality. It is an [**accounting dimension**](../setup/general-ledger-configuration.md#dimension-tab) which can be set up for a given general ledger configuration allowing organizations to analyze costs based on the activities that generate them, instead of relying only on traditional accounting dimensions.

In Etendo, an Activity is represents a type of work, process, or operation within an organization. Activities can be enabled in a General Ledger configuration and later used in accounting entries to improve **cost analysis**.

### Header

The **ABC Activity** window allows users to define and manage activities per organization.

Using this window, it is possible to:

- Create **multiple activities** for an organization.

- Define **summary activities** to build a hierarchical structure.

- Group **related activities** to simplify reporting and cost analysis.

This structure helps organizations understand how costs are distributed across different operational areas. From this window, it is possible to define summary activities which support a hierarchical structure or activities within an organization.

Some fields to note to create as many activities as required: 

- **Organization**: Organizational entity within client.
- **Search Key**: A fast method for finding a particular record.
- **Name**: A non-unique identifier for a record/document often used as a search tool.
- **Description**: A space to write additional related information.
- **Help/Comment**: A comment that adds additional information to help users work with fields.
- **Summary Level**: A means of grouping fields in order to view or hide additional information.
- **Active**: A flag indicating whether this record is available for use or de-activated.


### Example

A manufacturing company wants to analyze its operational costs in more detail so it defines the following ABC Activities:

- **Production** (Summary Activity)

    - **Assembly**

    - **Packaging**

- **Logistics** (Summary Activity)

    - **Warehousing**

    - **Shipping**

When invoices, expenses, or other accounting entries are posted, users can assign an **Activity** to each entry.

Later, the company can easily report on how much cost was generated by Production versus Logistics, or drill down into specific activities such as Assembly or Shipping.

This approach provides better cost visibility, supports more informed decision-making, and enhances financial analysis within Etendo ERP.
