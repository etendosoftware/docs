:material-menu: `Application` > `General Setup` > `Application` > `Create Sequences`

## Process Execution
In this process window, the **Create Sequences** process is executed.

When selecting the **organization** and executing the process, Etendo creates the sequences for the type of fields `Transactional Sequence` or `Non transactional Sequence`. The main advantage of these *new sequences* is dynamic masking, which makes it possible to add dates or dynamic strings.

!!! warning
    - The user can run this process only after a developer configures the sequence fields using `transactional` or `non-transactional` sequences.
    - For more information about this configuration, visit the technical documentation about [Sequences](../../../../../developer-guide/etendo-classic/how-to-guides/how-to-use-advanced-sequences.md).

## Document Sequence

:material-menu: `Financial Management`>`Accounting`>`Setup`>`Document Sequence`

After that, in the [Document Sequence](../../financial-management/accounting/setup.md#document-sequence) window the user can see and edit the sequences generated.
