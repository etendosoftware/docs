# Window Personalization

:material-menu: `Application` > `General Setup` > `Application` > `Window Personalization`

Etendo allows the customization of grid and form views. Customize windows and form views are stored once saved in the Window Personalization window. Etendo windows can be shown in *Form View* and in *Grid View*, both ways can be customized as required.

**Window Personalization** lists and maintains the customized form views.

Once a form has been customized, saved and listed in the **Window Personalization**window, it is possible to configure the levels of visibility where that form personalization will apply.
