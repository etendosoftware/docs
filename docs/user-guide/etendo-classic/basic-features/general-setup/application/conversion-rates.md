### Overview

Conversion rate also called currency exchange rate is the rate at which one currency may be converted into another one.

!!! info
    Conversion rates can only be created at system organization level (\*), which implies they are available for all the organizations within the client.

### Conversion Rate

Conversion rates window allows the user to create the rates to be used for multi currency transactions.

Etendo requires the user to enter and maintain currency exchange rate in both senses, that means to enter at the same time the two rates below:

- a _Multiple rate by_ which is the rate by which the base amount will be multiplied for to calculate the converted amount.
- and a _Divide rate by_ which is the rate by which the base amount will be divided by to calculate the converted amount.

For instance, USD exchange rate to EUR should have a _Multiple rate by_ = 0.68 setting and a _Divide rate by_ = 1.47 setting, as shown in the image below:
