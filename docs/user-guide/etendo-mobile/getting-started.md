## Server URL

Once the app is downloaded, the first step will be setting up the Etendo server URL.

For this, click the "Add new Link" button in Settings, enter the URL and click "Add new Link" again. Then, the URL will be shown in the “List of added URLs”.

In here, required URLs can be added, modified or removed.

## Log In

Once the server URL is configured, the user must log in entering the user and the password assigned by the system administrator.

The user will remain logged in, the system will require reentering the credentials only in case the session is ended (through the option Log out in the navigation menu) or the server URL is changed.

Etendo Mobile offers the possibility to connect to a demo server to test the app. In this case, the “demo try” button must be pressed and the user can enter without credential requirements.

The gear icon shown in the welcome window allows the user to enter the configuration window. (See Settings window).
