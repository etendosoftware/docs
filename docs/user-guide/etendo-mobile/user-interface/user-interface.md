# User Interface

## Etendo Mobile

### Settings Screen

In the Setting screen window, the user is able to set the language to use in the app and/or, before logging in, the URL server. 

!!!note
    Remember that as soon as the app is downloaded, the server URL must be set. 

In the **Add new Link** button, enter the URL and click Add new Link again. Then, the URL will be shown in the List of added URLs.

### Login Screen

Once the server URL is configured, the user must log in entering the user and the password assigned by the system administrator.

The user will remain logged in, the system will require reentering the credentials only in case the session is ended (through the option Log out in the navigation menu) or the server URL is changed.

### Profile Screen
In this section, the user can see the information of the logged in person: Name, Role, Organization, Client and Warehouse.

In case the user has a picture, it will be shown both in this window and in the top section of the navigation menu (See Navigation menu). For now, this will be modifiable from the back office only.

As regards the role, it can only be modified from the app, so each user will enter with their default role (setup in the Etendo Classic).
