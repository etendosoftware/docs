At its core, Etendo Copilot is a groundbreaking initiative that redefines how developers and users interact with tools and information. It revolves around a central component, the *Agent* which acts as the mastermind behind task delegation. This Agent has secondary modules referred to as *Tools*. The seamless communication between these components is facilitated via a RESTful API, ensuring a stateless and scalable interaction model.


## Agent

The Agent serves as your virtual assistant, making on-the-fly decisions about which Tool is best suited to respond to a particular query. This intelligent decision-making ensures that you receive the most accurate and efficient assistance.

## Tools

Each tool represents a separate independent project, designed to excel at specific tasks. Whether it is code translation, text analysis, or data manipulation, our collection of tools work in harmony to deliver unparalleled support.
