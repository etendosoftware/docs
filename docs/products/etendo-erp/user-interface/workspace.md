From the top navigation bar, the user can launch new documents via the Quick Menu functionalities or jump to existing documents via the Application menu.

### Quick Menu

**Create New:**  Through faster navigation, the user can access the creation of a new document, saving time and increasing the user experience. By using this functionality, a new document of a specific type is created on a new tab in form view.

### Application

Read more in the [Application areas](/docs.etendo.software/products/etendo-erp/user-interface/navigation/#application-areas) section.

!!! info
    *The contents of the Application Menu depend on the user's role. For example, one user can have various roles and see different things with each one.*

### Alerts

An alert is a notification that informs or warns the user about a critical or important situation. In this section, you can see and edit all your active alerts.

The number of new alerts is shown in the top navigation as Alerts (n). This link takes you to the Alerts Management tab. This tab shows four sections, each one representing a status or stage in the alert life cycle:

-   **New alerts:** Alerts that you have not marked as read/acknowledged and that are not ignored nor solved.
-   **Pending alerts:** Alerts the user has marked as read/pending because they do not want to see them in the new section anymore. The user would do this, for example, when they have taken care of the problem but this has not been updated in the system. A typical example is: Stock of product x dropped below critical level. The user just placed a new order by phone\*\*,\*\* but it will still take a day to receive the orders.
-   **Ignored alerts:** Alerts that the user does not want to see again. By placing them in the Ignored section, it means that they are now exceptions to the alert rule.
-   **Solved alerts:** Alerts are automatically moved to the solved section when the system notices that the alert threshold ceased to be violated. Note that you cannot mark alerts as “Solved” yourself.

### Help

Context-sensitive help can be accessed by clicking the item Help in the top navigation bar. This action opens a new tab to provide the user with specific information about any selected window. 
In this section, the user can also find information about the ERP.


### User Section

The name of this section varies according to the name set up by the client.

The User section is split in two tabs: Profile and Change Password.
