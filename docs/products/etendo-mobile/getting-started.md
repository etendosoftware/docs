## **Log In**

Once the server URL is configured, the user must log in entering the user and the password assigned by the system administrator.

The user will remain logged in, the system will require reentering the credentials only in case the session is ended (through the option Log out in the navigation menu) or the server URL is changed.

Etendo Mobile offers the possibility to connect to a demo server to test the app. In this case, the “demo try” button must be pressed and the user can enter without credential requirements.

The gear icon shown in the welcome window allows the user to enter the configuration window. (See Settings window).
