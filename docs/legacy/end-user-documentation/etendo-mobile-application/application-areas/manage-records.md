### **Create a record**

To create a new record, the user must click the icon with the symbol “+” and complete the desired fields. Those with the symbol (\*) are mandatory. 

To edit a field, the user must click the pencil icon. If the field is a list field, click the search icon to display possible options. After selecting the correct data, press the button “Done”.

If the field is a date type, when selecting the search icon a calendar to select the desired date will be displayed.

Free text fields are edited by selecting the field and entering the desired value. 

Once the user has entered the required data, click the save icon. 

When the Header is complete, data can be entered in the tabs. To do so, access through the Folders button and edit the required fields, in the same way as in the main Header. 

Each time a new record is created in the App, the same record will be created in the ERP as well. 

It is important to consider that the document will always remain in “Draft” status and can only be completed through the ERP. 

### **Delete a record**

To delete a record, press it and drag it to the left or hold it, select all the desired records and then the delete icon. 

Each time a record is deleted in the App, the same record will be deleted in the ERP as well.

### **Edit a record** 

To edit a record, select the record and then the field to be edited. 

Once the changes have been made, press the save icon. 

Each time a record is edited in the App, the same record will be edited in the ERP as well.

### **Search a record**

Records can be searched by inserting a value or keyword in the top "Search" bar. This search bar is located both in the main view of each window and in each tab.

Each window will have certain filters available by field which will match those fields configured by default to be displayed in the preview of each record. 

In case the user needs to add more filters or to remove some of them, customization will be required. 

Continuing with the example of the Sales invoice window, the available filters are the document number, which will be entered in the search bar together with the invoice date.
