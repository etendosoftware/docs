In the welcome window, the user can enter Profile, Settings and Navigation Menu.

### **Profile**

In this section, the user can see the information of the logged in person: Name, Role, Organization, Client and Warehouse.

In case the user has a picture, it will be shown both in this window and in the top section of the navigation menu (See Navigation menu). For now, this will be modifiable from the back office only.

As regards the role, it can only be modified from the app, so each user will enter with their default role (setup in the ERP).

### **Settings**

In this window, the following configurations are possible: modifying the language and/or, before log in, the server URL. 

The available languages so far are Spanish and English.

In the top section of the menu, the name and the user picture will be shown.

### **Functional Windows**

The user, according to their role, will have access to certain windows. The most common ones are: Product, Business Partner, Sales Invoice, Sales Order, Purchase Invoice, Purchase Order, among others.

The access to these windows are represented by folder icons with their corresponding name.

Each window will show its content splitting the records in small boxes, which will contain a preview of main data of these records. That data is configured by default and a customization must be required in case the user wants to add more fields to eliminate some of them, considering that only a max of 5 fields can be displayed. 

The same field present in the preview, will be the criteria by which you can filter if you want to search for a record. (View Actions on records>Find a record.) 

Considering as an example the Sales invoice window, the preview of each record provides information regarding the document number and invoice date.

By clicking any of those boxes, detailed information about the records will be displayed.  

The fields will be displayed one below the other. Those with this symbol  “(\*)” in their title are mandatory and those with a pencil icon are editable.

When entering any of the tabs, the view will be the same as in the parent window, e.i., the records will be displayed in small boxes and, when entering these, the fields will be displayed one below the other.
