## Grid View

The grid view functions as the base view and often as a starting point to filtering and drilling down. The user can open a record in the form view on top of the grid. 

The interaction metaphor that is used is that of a file explorer of an operating system. The grid is the folder with files, a double click opens the record. The record in form view can be closed at any time by clicking the close (X) button in the top right corner of the form.

A record (Form view) in the grid can be opened via:
- A double click on the row
- Pressing the <ENTER> key on the keyboard
- Clicking the form/document icon on the left side of the row

###   Filtering
  
  In the grid view, the user can apply filters using the different filter boxes and clean them with the funnel button on the right side of the screen.
