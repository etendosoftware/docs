In the Currency Converters window the necessary Apilayer data has to be configured:
- Classname: com.smf.currency.apiconfig.CurrencyLayerConverter
- URL: http://apilayer.net/api/
- Token
- User
- Password

In the Conversion Rate Downloader Rule window the configuration includes which conversions are required from which currency to which currency, what is the tolerance, etc.

The "Conversion Rate Downloader" process in the background also needs to be configured. This is the one that will obtain the conversion and insert it in the Conversion Rates window.
