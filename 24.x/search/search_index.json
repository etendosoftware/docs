Another way of describing this is that the sales order lines depend on the sales order header, a sales order line can not exist without its sales order header and when a sales order header is removed also its sales order lines should be removed.</p> <p>The DAL uses the foreign keys from the child to parent to create the parent- child association in Java and Hibernate. More specifically: the foreign key columns which have the field isParent set to yes (checked/true) define the business object parent-child relations, other foreign key columns define standard many-to-one associations. For example the foreign key field c_order_id in c_order_line is used to create the one-to-many association (in the in-memory runtime model) from c_order to c_order_line . This one- to-many association is then used to generate a List member in the Java Order class and a one-to-many mapping in Hibernate. <p>It is possible not to generate those one-to-many associations in the parent entity.

The runtime model is especially useful in generic functionality such as import and export and security and validation.</p> <p>The runtime model consists of two main concepts:</p> <ul> <li>Entity: an entity models a database table and its associations to and from other tables (i.e. entities). An entity has an Entityname which is globally unique. In addition, an entity has a runtime Java class which is used for the runtime Java representation. The entity class has methods to retrieve the full list of properties, the ID properties or the identifier properties. </li> <li>Property: a property corresponds to a column in the database. Some property specifics: <ul> <li>A property can be a primitive property (String, Date, numeric) or a reference to another entity (which can be retrieved through the getTargetEntity method). </li> <li>A property can be part of the primary key ( isId() == true ). </li> <li>A property can be part of the identifier of an entity ( isIdentifier() == true ). </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The runtime model is available through the  ModelProvider  class (in org.openbravo.base.model ) which can be retrieved by calling ModelProvider.getInstance() . The ModelProvider offers several methods to retrieve Entities from the in-memory model (the full list, by entity name or by Java class).</p> <p>The runtime model makes it possible to use model-driven development techniques also at runtime. For example, the runtime model together with the dynamic API offered by the BaseOBObject makes it possible to iterate through all properties (and their values) of a business object without knowing the exact type of the business objects.</p> <p>The example below illustrates how to do this. This method below will translate any Etendo Classic business entity into a simple XML document using the runtime model and the dynamic API: <pre><code>      private void printXML(BaseOBObject bob) {\n        // used to print a bit nicer xml\n        final String indent = \"\\t \";\n\n        // get the entity from the runtime model using the entity name of the object\n        final String entityName = bob.getEntityName();\n        final Entity e = ModelProvider.getInstance().getEntity(entityName);\n        // Note: bob.getEntity() also gives the entity of the object\n    \u00a0\n\n        // print the opening tag\n        System.err.println(\"&lt;\" + e.getName() + \"&gt;\");\n\n        // iterate through the properties of the entity\n        for (Property p\u00a0: e.getProperties()) {\n\n          // and get the value through the dynamic api offered by the BaseOBObject\n          final Object value = bob.get(p.getName());\n\n          // handle null, just create an empty tag for that\n          if (value == null) {\n            System.err.println(indent + \"&lt;\" + p.getName() + \"/&gt;\");\n            continue;\n          }\n\n          // make a difference between a primitive and a reference type\n          if (p.isPrimitive()) {\n            // in reality some form of xml conversion/encoding should take place...\n            System.err.println(indent + \"&lt;\" + p.getName() + \"&gt;\" + value + \"&lt;/\" + p.getName() + \"&gt;\");\n          } else {\n            // cast to the parent of all openbravo objects\n            final BaseOBObject referencedObject = (BaseOBObject) value;\n            // assumes that the id is always a primitive type\n            System.err.println(indent + \"&lt;\" + p.getName() + \"&gt;\" + referencedObject.getId() + \n            \"&lt;/\" + p.getName() + \"&gt;\");\n          }\n        }\n\n        // and the closing tag\n        System.err.println(\"&lt;/\" + e.getName() + \"&gt;\");\n      }\n</code></pre> This example executes the following steps:</p> <ul> <li>Get the entityname from the object and retrieve the Entity from the runtime model through the ModelProvider instance. </li> <li>Create an opening tag and iterate through all properties of the entity (i.e. all columns of the table). </li> <li>For each property, do the following: <ol> <li>Get the value for the property from the business object through the dynamic API. </li> <li>Handle null values and check if the property is a primitive type or not. </li> <li>For a primitive type, just print the value. </li> <li>For a reference type, cast the value to a BaseOBObject and print the ID of the referenced object. </li> </ol> </li> </ul> <p>The above method will print the following output for a business partner group like the one stored in the hello world example above: <pre><code>    &lt;CoreBPGroup&gt;\n         &lt;deflt&gt;true&lt;/deflt&gt;\n         &lt;description&gt;hello world&lt;/description&gt;\n         &lt;name&gt;hello world&lt;/name&gt;\n         &lt;value&gt;hello world&lt;/value&gt;\n         &lt;updatedby&gt;1000001&lt;/updatedby&gt;\n         &lt;updated&gt;Sat Oct 04 12:31:57 CEST 2008&lt;/updated&gt;\n         &lt;createdby&gt;1000001&lt;/createdby&gt;\n         &lt;created&gt;Sat Oct 04 12:31:57 CEST 2008&lt;/created&gt;\n         &lt;active&gt;true&lt;/active&gt;\n         &lt;org&gt;1000000&lt;/org&gt;\n         &lt;client&gt;1000000&lt;/client&gt;\n         &lt;id&gt;ff8081811cc769b4011cc769e49b0002&lt;/id&gt;\n    &lt;/CoreBPGroup&gt;\n</code></pre> In general, when you are working with very generic code (cross-cutting concerns) which applies to all business objects, then using the runtime model can be considered.</p>","tags":["Data Access Layer","Etendo","Etendo Classic","Business Logic","Hibernate","Database","Business Object","Development","Architecture"]},{"location":"developer-guide/etendo-classic/concepts/Data_Access_Layer/#testing","title":"Testing","text":"<p>It is of vital importance to follow a test-driven development approach for every development project.

We will define the module using the following three tabs of the <code>Application Dictionary</code> &gt; <code>Module</code> window:</p> <ul> <li>Dependency</li> <li>DB Prefix</li> <li>Data Package</li> </ul> <p>Dependency: Etendo Classic core functionality is in itself a module, called Core. All modules have a dependency on User Interface Application and in turn, it has a dependency on Etendo core. In the Dependency window, specify that the module is dependent on User Interface Application. (see also the  AD_Module_Dependency description):</p> <p></p> <p>DB Prefix: at least one db prefix is required when a module also contains database artifacts (table, column, constraints, etc.). Etendo Classic determines the module of a database artifact by checking to see if its name starts with one of the defined db_prefixes. If database artifacts will be added to the module, at least one DB prefix must be specified.</p> <p>Important</p> <p>DB Prefix can only contain uppercase [A-Z0-9] and the first letter is required to be from [A-Z] only.  </p> <p></p> <p>Info</p> <p>For more information, see the  AD_Module_Dbprefix  table description.</p> <p>Data Package: Tables are linked to a module through the Data Package. The generated business object for the new table will use the Java Package defined in the  Data Package. If new tables are to be added to the module, a data package must be specified as illustrated in the image below.</p> <p></p>","tags":["Etendo Classic","Modularity","Create a module","Package a module","Module"]},{"location":"developer-guide/etendo-classic/how-to-guides/How_To_Create_a_Module/#develop-your-software-artifacts","title":"Develop your software artifacts","text":"<p>Now, let's see how to develop the software artifacts required for the functionality of the module.

Again, use the ad_column_identifier function as shown to retrieve all column values required to uniquely identify the problematic record within the specific table. </li> <li>isActive - should always be set to 'Y' </li> <li>ad_org_id - should be inherited from the actual record that triggers the alert, in this case, the record from the C_BPartner table </li> <li>ad_client_id - should be inherited from the actual record that triggers the alert, in this case, the record from the C_BPartner table </li> <li>created - should always be set to now() </li> <li>createdBy - should always be set to 0 </li> <li>updated - should always be set to now() </li> <li>updatedBy - should always be set to 0 </li> </ul> <p>Finally, the WHERE clause describes the condition that triggers the alert.

When you now enter a new entry in the window, you will see an additional translation child record being created.</p> <p></p>","tags":["HowTo","Etendo Classic","Event Handler","Business Logic","Event Method"]},{"location":"developer-guide/etendo-classic/how-to-guides/How_to_implement_a_business_event_handler/#interrupt-the-save-action","title":"Interrupt the Save Action","text":"<p>Sometimes you need to interrupt the save action because the user is doing something wrong, this can be done throwing an exception</p> <pre><code>public void onUpdate(@Observes\nEntityUpdateEvent event) {\n  if (!isValidEvent(event)) {\n    return;\n  }\n  final OBSA_Orderline_Assign olineAssign = (OBSA_Orderline_Assign) event.getTargetInstance();\n  if (olineAssign.getProductWithStorage().getProduct()\u00a0!= olineAssign.getSalesOrderLine()\n      .getProduct()) {\n    String language = OBContext.getOBContext().getLanguage().getLanguage();\n    ConnectionProvider conn = new DalConnectionProvider(false);\n    throw new OBException(Utility.messageBD(conn, \"OBSA_ErrorProduct\", language));\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>","tags":["HowTo","Etendo Classic","Event Handler","Business Logic","Event Method"]},{"location":"developer-guide/etendo-classic/how-to-guides/How_to_implement_a_business_event_handler/#examples-of-business-entity-event-handlers","title":"Examples of Business Entity Event Handlers","text":"<p>Etendo Classic uses business entity event handlers to implement business logic in various locations, here are some examples:</p> <ul> <li>ModuleHandler</li> <li>SetDocumentNoHandler</li> </ul> <p>The complete source code of the example event handler is available here</p> <p>This work is a derivative of How to implement a business event handler by Openbravo Wiki, used under CC BY-SA 2.5 ES.

Unfortunately, the context in the XML file is not clear at all, and sometimes it is necessary to dive into the application to get the exact context.

AD_MENU_TRL represents the Application menu entries, AD_MESSAGE_TRL has all the messages, AD_PROCESS_TRL is in charge of the process and reports, AD_PROCESS_PARA_TRL is the process parameters, etc.</li> <li>If you are translating using PO files you can find information related to the string you are translating at the comments section. As you can see in the previous screenshot, the PoEdit comment window displays the name, description and help for the string we are currently translating.</li> <li> <p>The Etendo Linked Items feature can give you all the places where a record is used. In the screenshot below, you can get the places where the element with the name \u201cGeneral Ledger Currency Credit\u201d is used.

In the XML file, this ID is shown as an attribute of the row element. In the PO files, it is stored as a comment that can be easily displayed in your PO editor comments window. If we search this ID in the database, it can provide us with important information.     For example, it is necessary to get more information about the message \"Business Partner has no location defined.\" with the ID \"04EEC6B52A7B4C2CACA1F767217FAFB7\".

Parameters, onLoad functions, etc. are supported.</p> </li> <li>Create a column and a field to run the Action from a button in the current UI, or a menu entry to run the process from the menu.</li> <li>The Java class associated with the new Action must extend the Action type (<code>com.smf.jobs.Action</code>).</li> </ol> <p>Your IDE of choice should prompt you to fill the required methods:</p> <ul> <li><code>ActionResult action(JSONObject parameters, MutableBoolean isStopped)</code></li> <li><code>Class&lt;T&gt; getInputClass()</code></li> </ul> <p>The first <code>action()</code> method is where the main process logic happens. You will receive the process parameters in a json object, and a boolean to check if the process was requested to stop. Once the logic is done, your code should return an <code>ActionResult</code> type detailing if the execution was successfully finished or not. There will also be a message for the user.</p> <p>The <code>getInputClass()</code> method must return the class type this Actions supports as an input. For example <code>Invoice.class:</code></p> <pre><code>import org.openbravo.model.common.invoice.Invoice;\n/* ... */\n@Override\nprotected Class&lt;Invoice&gt; getInputClass() {\n    return Invoice.class;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The input data (the user selected record(s), or the result of another Action) can be obtained with the method <code>getInputContents()</code>. By default, this method will return a list of <code>BaseOBObject</code>, but it can be parametrized using the previous <code>getInputClass()</code> method (or the class directly). For example:</p> <pre><code>// Assuming getInputClass() returns Invoice.class\nList&lt;Invoice&gt; invoices = getInputContents(getInputClass());\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>ActionResult</code> type can be used to show a message to the user:</p> <pre><code>result.setType(Result.Type.ERROR);\nresult.setMessage(OBMessageUtils.getI18NMessage(\"Success\"));\n/* ... */\nreturn result;\n</code></pre> <p>The result object can also set an output to be used as input for the next job, when the new Job UI is implemented:</p> <pre><code>List&lt;Invoices&gt; invoices = processInvoices();\nresult.setOutput(invoices);\n</code></pre> <p>For more complex operations present in standard processes, the <code>setResponseActionsBuilder()</code> method can be used to set a response builder.

Can contain one or more tools.</p> <p>.gitignore: Contains the files that will be ignored by git.</p> <p>build.gradle: Contains the configuration of the module. This file is created when the module is prepared to be published. See  How to publish modules to GitHub repository</p> <p>tools_deps.toml: Contains the dependencies of the tools of the module. This file contains the dependencies of the tools of the module.</p> </li> <li> <p>Create the file <code>PingTool.py</code> in the <code>tools</code> folder. This file will contain the code of the tool. The code of the tool will be as follows, the comments explain the code:</p> PingTool.py<pre><code>import os\nfrom copilot.core.tool_wrapper import ToolWrapper # Import the ToolWrapper class from the copilot.core.tool_wrapper module. This class is the one that must be extended to create a new tool.\n\nclass PingTool (ToolWrapper):\n    name = 'PingTool' # Name of the tool\n    description = ('''This tool receives a hostname and returns the ping result.''') # Description of the tool. This description tells Copilot what the tool does and based on this description it will decide if this tool will solve the user's request.\n\n    def run(self, host: str, *args, **kwargs): # The run method is the one that will be executed when the tool is executed. The inputs of the method are the inputs of the tool.\n        import requests # Import the necessary libraries to execute the tool. It is recommended to import the libraries inside the run method to avoid conflicts with other tools.\n        response = requests.get(host)\n        return {\"status_code\": response.status_code}  # The run method must return a dictionary with the outputs of the tool.\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>The name of the tool must be the same as the name of the class that extends the ToolWrapper class.</p> </li> <li> <p>In case the tool needs more than one input, its necessary to use a Dict as input. In order to do that, we have to create a new class that defines the inputs of the tool using pydantic. Here is an example of a tool that receives a Dict as input, with the structure of the Dict defined in a class:</p> PingTool.py<pre><code>import os\nfrom typing import Type, Dict\n\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n\nfrom copilot.core.tool_wrapper import ToolWrapper  # Import the ToolWrapper class from the copilot.core.tool_wrapper module. This class is the one that must be extended to create a new tool.\n\n\nclass PingToolInput(BaseModel):\n    host: str = Field(\n        title=\"Host\",\n        description='''The host to ping.''',\n    )\n    message_to_print: str = Field(\n        default=\"default message!\",  # Default value of the input, if there is no default value, the input is mandatory.\n        title=\"Message to print\",\n        description=\" Custom message to print before the ping result.\",\n    )\n\n\nclass PingTool(ToolWrapper):\n    name = 'PingTool'  # Name of the tool\n    # Description of the tool.\n    # This description tells Copilot what the tool does and based on this description it will decide if this tool will solve the user's request.\n    description = (\n        '''This tool receives a hostname and returns the ping result.''')\n    args_schema: Type[\n        BaseModel] = PingToolInput  # The args_schema attribute must be a Pydantic model that defines the inputs of the tool.\n\n    #return_direct = True  # If return_direct is True, the tool will return the result directly, without execute any other tool. If return_direct is not defined, the tool output can be used as input of another tool. This is only available for tools in the Langchain agent. In the OpenAI agent, the return_direct attribute is taken into account, and the tool output can be used as input of another tool.\n\n    def run(self, input_params: Dict, *args,\n            **kwargs):  # The run method is the one that will be executed when the tool is executed.\n        import requests  # Import the necessary libraries to execute the tool.\n        # It is recommended to import the libraries inside the run method to avoid conflicts with other tools.\n        host = input_params.get('host')  # Get the host input from the input_params dictionary.\n        # Get the message_to_print input from the input_params dictionary\n        # or from the args attribute that contains the default values of the inputs.\n        message_to_print = input_params.get('message_to_print') or self.args.get('message_to_print').get('default')\n        print('MESSAGE:' + message_to_print)\n        response = requests.get(host)\n        return {\"status_code\": response.status_code}  # The run method must return a dictionary with the outputs of the tool.\n</code></pre> <p>Enviroment variables</p> <p>Automatically, Copilot reads the gradle.properties file of Etendo Classic and add configuration as environment variables. The name of the environment variable will be the same as the name of the property. The only difference is that the . is replaced by _. For example, if we have the property <code>COPILOT_PORT</code> in the gradle.properties file, Copilot will create the environment variable <code>COPILOT_PORT</code>. If we have the property <code>bbdd.sid</code> in the gradle.properties file, Copilot will create the environment variable <code>bbdd_sid</code>.  This allows us to use the environment variables in the tools. </p> </li> <li> <p>Create the file <code>tools_deps.toml</code> in the root folder of the module. This file will contain the dependencies of the tools of the module. The content of the file follows the TOML format. The content of the file will be as follows:</p> <p><pre><code>[ToolName]\ndependency_name = \"dependency_version\"\ndependency_name = \"dependency_version\"\n</code></pre> For our example, the content of the file will be as follows:</p> <p><pre><code>[PingTool]\nrequests = \"*\"\n</code></pre> The name of the tool must be the same as the name of the class that extends the ToolWrapper class. In our case, the name of the tool is <code>PingTool</code> and the name of the class that extends the ToolWrapper class is also <code>PingTool</code>. During the load of copilot, the tool will be loaded and the dependencies will be installed. Additionally, the dependencies will be tested to ensure that they are installed correctly.</p> <p>The version of the dependency can be specified or not. If the version is not specified, the latest version will be installed. If the version is specified, the version specified will be installed. The version can be specified with the following operators: <pre><code>[PingTool]\nrequests = \"*\" # Installing latest version\nrequests = \"==2.26.0\" # Installing a specific version\nrequests = \"&gt;=2.26.0\" # Greater than or equal to a certain version\nrequests = \"&lt;=2.26.0\" # Less than or equal to a certain version\nrequests = \"&gt;2.26.0\" # Greater than a certain version\nrequests = \"&lt;2.26.0\" # Less than a certain version\nrequests = \"&gt;=2.26.0,&lt;=2.26.1\" # Using version ranges\nrequests = \"~=2.26.0\" # Tilde operator (~) for installing compatible versions\n</code></pre></p> <p>Different name of depedency while installing and importing</p> <p>If the name of the dependency is different from the name of the dependency that is imported in the tool, it is necessary to specify the name of the dependency that is imported in the tool. For example, if the dependency is installed with the name <code>pyscopg2-binary</code> but is imported with the name <code>psycopg2</code>, we can use a | to specify both names. The content of the file will be as follows:</p> <pre><code>[PingTool]\nrequests2 = \"*\" \n\n[OtherTool]\n\"pyscopg2-binary|psycopg2\" = \"*\"   # First name is the name of the dependency that is installed, second name is the name of the dependency that is imported. In the tool code, we will do import psycopg2\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Additionaly, open the Copilot Tool window as System Administrator role. In this window we will create a new record, with the following information:</p> <ul> <li>Search key: The tool search key. The same name as the tool class must be used, this field is mandatory to find the tool in the <code>Sync Tool Structure</code> process. </li> <li>Name: The name of the tool. It is the name that will be shown in the Copilot UI.</li> <li>Description: This is a description of what the tool does. This field is automatically populated when the tool is synchronized.</li> <li>Module: The module where the tool is located. This field is a reference to the module that we have created in the first step, and where these configurations will be exported.</li> <li>JSON Info: Contains a JSON descrition of the tool. This field is automatically filled when the tool is synchronized. </li> </ul> <p>The last step is get the Tool parameter information from the tool class. This information is used to create the parameters in the Copilot App. To do so, we have to execute the button <code>Sync Tool Structure</code> in the <code>Copilot Tool</code> window. This process will load the Description and the JSON Info fields of the tool. This data is get from the tool class.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>Is mandatory to have copilot running and the tool loaded in the copilot container. If the tool is not loaded, the process will not retrieve the tool parameters.</p> <p></p> <p>After creating the record, we have to export the module to persist the changes in the database: Terminal<pre><code>./gradlew export.database\n</code></pre> Once the Copilot Tool is defined, this tool must be associated to the copilot app(s), to do so, a record must be created in the tools tab of the Copilot App window, this record will allow us to activate or deactivate the tool.</p> <p></p> <p>OpenAI Assistants tools</p> <p>Remember to excecute <code>Sync OpenAI Assistant</code> process after linking the tool, if not, the tool will not be available in the OpenAI Assistant.</p> </li> <li> <p>Finally, restart the Copilot service and check that the tool and its dependencies have been installed correctly.  To test the developed Tool, you can ask Copilot to run it or, for example, to list which tools are available.</p> Terminal<pre><code>./gradlew copilot.do -Pprompt=\"What tools do you have available?\"\n</code></pre> </li> </ol>","tags":["Copilot","IA","Machine Learning"]},{"location":"developer-guide/etendo-copilot/installation/","title":"Copilot Installation","text":"","tags":["Copilot","IA","Machine Learning"]},{"location":"developer-guide/etendo-copilot/installation/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>The getting started guide for the Copilot API is a tool that allows interaction with a bot that selects the appropriate tool to answer a query.</p>","tags":["Copilot","IA","Machine Learning"]},{"location":"developer-guide/etendo-copilot/installation/#etendo-copilot","title":"Etendo Copilot","text":"<p> Javapackage: <code>com.etendoerp.copilot</code></p>","tags":["Copilot","IA","Machine Learning"]},{"location":"developer-guide/etendo-copilot/installation/#requirements","title":"Requirements","text":"<ul> <li>Etendo Classic.

Accounting rules such as the Currency and the Chart of Accounts among others.</p> <p>Having said that, the accounting configuration detailed in this section is the one required for legal entities with accounting, including the business units, because these organization types are the only ones which can have assigned:</p> <ul> <li>a Chart of Accounts</li> <li>a General Ledger configuration</li> <li>and a Fiscal Calendar</li> </ul> <p>Obviously these organization types allow posting transactions to the ledger. Rest of the Organization types behave as explained in the Initial Organization Setup and in the Organization section.</p> <p>Very briefly:</p> <ul> <li>Legal without accounting organizations do not require accounting therefore do not require any basic nor advanced accounting configuration.</li> <li>Generic organizations however can have their own General Ledger configuration and Chart of Accounts but the accounting periods can not be opened and closed independently at its level. This type of organization inherits the Fiscal Calendar of the legal with accounting organization they belong to.</li> <li>and finally Organization ones can have as well a general ledger configuration and a Chart of Accounts but with the aim of being shared among all the organizations underneath. This organization type can not have a fiscal calendar assigned and besides the transactions within it are not allowed.</li> </ul> <p>Additionally, some countries such as Spain or France require that a specific Chart of Accounts is used in the statutory books, therefore the authorities can see the same list of accounts and the same level of detail in the Income statement and in the Balance Sheet.</p> <p>On the other hand, there are countries such as the USA where a specific Chart of Accounts is not required.</p> <p>For those cases Etendo provides a Generic Chart of Accounts module which includes a sample Chart of Accounts which can be modified as required. It is recommended to start from a sample chart of accounts like the generic one and evolve it for the organization's needs rather than starting from scratch.</p> <p>In-country taxes setup is another key element of the basic accounting configuration. There can be Localization Packs which include the setup of the taxes for the country while there can be others which do not include the setup of the taxes for the country.

This kind of adjustment is not required if the organization follows the accrual method of accounting that is Etendo method of accounting. Under the accrual method of accounting, revenue is recorded as soon as services are provided or goods are delivered and therefore invoiced, regardless of when cash is received. Similarly, expenses are recognized as soon as the company receives goods or services and therefore gets invoiced, regardless of when it actually pays for them.</p> </li> <li> <p>the organization needs to calculate the Cost of Goods Sold (CoGS).

This method allows very accurate recordkeeping as to the Cost of Goods Sold which is the sum of the cost of all the items sold over the period.</p> <p>The periodic method is used by any business that counts inventory at regular intervals.    When using this method Cost of Goods Sold is calculated using the following equation:    (Beginning Inventory + Inventory purchases - Ending Inventory = Cost of Goods Sold)    Besides if a business is dealing with changing per-unit inventory costs, a specific method of calculating the CoGS needs to be used, that could either be FIFO, LIFO or Average Cost.</p> <p>Finally an income statement can separate Operating Expenses such as salaries and rent from Non-Operating Expenses such as a lawsuit.</p> <p>Operating Expenses are the expenses related to the normal operation of the business and are likely to be incurred in future periods as well.</p> <p>This way allows the calculation of the Operating Income as the difference between the Gross Profit and the Total Operating Expenses.</p>","tags":["getting started","financial management","payment","accounting","assets"]},{"location":"user-guide/etendo-classic/basic-features/financial-management/getting-started/#adjustments-required-prior-to-the-closing-of-the-accounting-year","title":"Adjustments required prior to the closing of the accounting year","text":"<p>Other adjustments required can be:</p> <ul> <li>Long term amounts must be reclassified to short term amounts.

There are four types of elements:</p> <ul> <li>\"Heading\", \"Breakdown\" and \"Account\" elements help to structure the chart of accounts in a way that the financial reports can be produced based upon that structure</li> <li>\"Subaccount\" element allows the user to post the transactions to the ledger</li> </ul> <p>Besides, it is well-known that every account, subaccount in Etendo terms, needs to be included in a financial statement:</p> <ul> <li>\"Asset\", \"Liability\" and \"Owner's Equity\" account types need to be included in the Balance Sheet</li> <li>while \"Expense\" and \"Revenue\" account types need to be included in the Profit &amp; Loss.</li> </ul> <p>The best way to understand how a chart of accounts is captured in Etendo is by pressing the \"Tree\" icon\u00a0 </p> <p>Tree icon opens a new window which shows one tree branch per financial statement:</p> <ul> <li>Balance Sheet</li> <li>Profit &amp; Loss</li> <li>and Temporary default accounts. This branch of the account tree gathers temporary defaults accounts which are not ledger accounts.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Besides, each tree branch contains several elements inside structured in a hierarchical way, for instance:</p> <ul> <li>Balance Sheet branch is split into:<ul> <li>Assets</li> <li>Liabilities and Owner's Equity</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>As shown in the image above \"Assets\" is also split into:</p> <ul> <li>Current Assets</li> <li>Long term Assets</li> <li>and Accumulated Depreciation</li> </ul> <p>Same way \"Equity\" is also split into several accounts, in Etendo terms \"subaccounts\", such as \"Capital Stock\" or \"Retained Earnings\".</p> <p>Back to the \"Element Value\" tab, there are several basic fields which help to define each chart of account element:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>the \"Search Key\" and the \"Name\" identifies the chart of account element.<ul> <li>The search key can either be a single letter, a word or a number, however it is important to be aware that the \"Search key\" field is the field that Etendo uses while helping the user to create an account tree element.</li> </ul> </li> <li>the Account Sign field is only shown and therefore editable if the general ledger configuration linked to the account tree is \"NOT\" set as \"Centrally Maintained\".     In that case, the account sign of each account tree element defines how the balance of that account is going to be shown in the financial statements:<ul> <li>if the account sign of an account tree element is \"Debit\", the balance of that account will then be shown as (Debit - Credit).<ul> <li>\"Asset\" accounts type are normally set as Debit, therefore its debit balance is shown as positive in the Balance Sheet.     In the same way, its credit balance is then shown as negative in the Balance Sheet.</li> </ul> </li> <li>if the account sign of an account tree element is \"Credit\", the balance of that account will then be shown as (Credit - Debit).<ul> <li>\"Liability\" account types are normally set as Credit, therefore its credit balance is shown as positive in the Balance Sheet. Same applies to the \"Owner's Equity\" account type.</li> <li>\"Revenue\" account types are set as Credit, therefore its Credit balance is shown as positive in the P&amp;L report.</li> <li>\"Expense\" account types are set as Credit, therefore its Debit balance is shown as negative in the P&amp;L report.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>\"Element Level\". As already mentioned, there are four types of elements which help to structure a chart of accounts in a way that the financial reports can be produced right away based upon the chart of accounts structure.     It is important to remark that it is not mandatory to use the four elements but just the ones which help us to properly structure the Chart of Accounts,     having into account that the lowest one \"Subaccount\" is the only mandatory one because ledger entries are posted to the ledger through the subaccounts.     The four element types are:<ul> <li>Heading - the elements \"B - Balance Sheet\" and \"1000-Assets\" are heading type elements because those are at the top ones having other elements underneath.</li> <li>Breakdown - the element \"1100 - Current Assets\" and \"1500 - Long-term Assets\" are a breakdown of the heading \"1000-Assets\".     Often, the assets and liabilities on a balance sheet are broken down into current assets and long-term assets. Breakdown element type helps us to define this kind of situations.</li> <li>Account - this level would help to split the element \"1100 - Current Assets\" into \"1110 - Cash\", \"1200 - Accounts Receivable\", etc, as a way to distinguish between the different types of current assets.</li> <li>Subaccount - this level is the lowest level of detail. For instance, the account element \"1110 - Cash\" can be split into the subaccounts \"1120 - Checking Account\" and \"1140 - Petty Cash\" subaccount to distinguish while posting to the ledger the transactions paid by check from the ones paid by petty cash.</li> </ul> </li> <li>\"Account Type\". The options available are Asset, Liability, Owner's equity, Revenue and Expense. Asset, Liability and Owner's equity account types are included in the Balance Sheet as well as in the \"balance sheet closing entry\" as described in the Close Year article. Revenue and Expense account types are included in the Income Statement as well as in the \"P&amp;L closing entry\" as described in the Close Year article.</li> <li>\"Summary Level\" defines if an account tree element groups other levels underneath or not, therefore heading, account and breakdown levels can be marked as summary levels while subaccount should not. There can be heading elements which group other elements underneath, for instance the element \"1000-Assets\" while there can be heading elements which do not need to group other elements underneath but Customize Elements, for instance the element \"1900-Total Assets\". The first type needs to be configured as \"Summary Level\", the second type does not need to. Moreover:<ul> <li>the amounts displayed in financial reports such as the Balance Sheet and the Income statement for a non-summary element is the sum of the debit and credit amounts posted to that account (subaccount).     The balance of that particular subaccount will then be shown as either positive or negative depending on its account sign or depending on what is centrally configured in the General Ledger Configuration</li> <li>the amounts displayed in financial reports such as the Balance Sheet and the Income statement for a summary element is the sum of the amounts of the elements underneath.     The balance of that summary element will then be shown as either positive or negative depending on its account sign or depending on what is centrally configured in the General Ledger Configuration.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Additionally, there are other advanced fields which also help to configure more unusual scenarios. Those fields are:</p> <ul> <li>the \"Show Value Condition\" field defines if a chart of account element balance is going to be shown and taken into account in financial reports or not. The options available are:<ul> <li>Algebraic, the chart of account element will be shown anyway regardless of the sign of its balance. This is the most commonly used.</li> <li>Negative Only, it will be shown only in case its balance is negative</li> <li>Positive Only, same as the previous one but just in case its balance is positive.</li> </ul> </li> <li>\"Element Shown\" defines if an account tree element is going to be shown in the financial reports or not. This one can be used for elements used to execute calculations which do not need to be shown in a report.</li> <li>\"Title Node\" defines if an account tree element is going to be shown in the financial reports just as a \"Title\" without including its balance. This option works for heading account tree elements which balance is not 100% accurate for whatever kind of reason as there is another element which gets the correct balance value by using operations or customized elements between a set of given elements.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"user-guide/etendo-classic/basic-features/financial-management/accounting/setup/#customized-elements","title":"Customized Elements","text":"<p>The customized elements tab allows the user to get an account tree element as a combination of a given list of existing elements.</p> <p>Once the account tree elements have been selected in a new record and in the correct sequence order, it is not required to specify a sign but just the elements which are going to be included.

also takes into account the cost of the goods sold, therefore the gross profit refers to the sum of an organization's revenues minus the cost of goods sold.</p> <p>Besides, it is very common to separate the \"Operating Expenses\" from the \"Non-Operating Expenses\", therefore it is possible to calculate the operating income as the difference between the gross profit and the operating expenses while the net income is the difference between the operating income and the non-operating expenses.</p> <p>All of the above drives the creation of the nodes/ elements which once arranged will

Keep in mind that we can select the tax we want for this line. The selection of the default tax is achieved by the C_GetTax DB stored procedure. The rules followed by this procedure are as follows:</p> <p>For sale transactions with an associated project, if a project has a tax rate, this tax rate is taken. This works when an order is generated by a Project (Order). In this case, the tax is taken directly from the project line tax. For sale transactions, if a partner is marked as tax-exempt, the selected tax will be the one checked as exempt with the most recent date relative to the ordered or invoiced date.</p> <p>Otherwise, the tax is selected from the ones defined in the same tax category as the product on the line. Taxes with defined business partner tax category can only be applied to those business partners with the same tax category (for vendor or customer). If the tax does not have a business partner tax category, it can be applied to any partner (with or without an associated tax category). If a tax with business partner tax category and another one without it can both be applied, the one with business partner tax category will be selected. In addition to this, the \u201cto\u201d and \u201cfrom\u201d locations are taken into account. At first, those taxes defined for closer regions are selected (if a tax is for region and another one for country, the region one will be selected). This information is associated to the tax rate, through the \u201cTax Zone\u201d tab. Taxes are applied taking into account if they are defined as Sales, Purchases or Both.</p> <p>Apart from these rules, and only in the case of Purchase/Sales Orders and Invoices, the system filters the tax rates taking into account the Cash VAT flag defined at the document's header too, which is automatically set based on the organization's and the business partner's configuration for sales and purchase documents respectively (although it can be manually overridden afterwards). Thus, in case the document is enabled for the Cash VAT regime, the system will get a Cash VAT tax rate and the other way around.</p> <p>Once the tax is selected (the default one, or another one selected by the user), an approximated amount is calculated by the SL_Order_Tax or SL_Invoice_Tax callouts. If the tax is checked as summary, the calculation will be done using the rate defined in the parent, not exploding it and taking the real values from its children. In addition, information c_order_tax and c_invoice_tax tables are populated with taxes at this point. The actual amount is calculated when the document is processed.</p> <p>When creating a new invoice, it is possible to write down taxes manually and check them as \u201cno recalculate\u201d. In this case, the tax is applied with the amount written down in the tax tab of the invoice, so no recalculation will be done while processing the invoice. When a tax in an invoice is marked as recalculated, if the tax is edited manually all changes will be lost when processing the invoice. This is because the tax amount of the invoice is recalculated. \u201cNo recalculate\u201d taxes are not associated to any invoice line, whereas the recalculated ones are. So when a tax comes from a line, it will be checked as recalculate.

For instance, an existing tax rate increases its rate, in this case:<ul> <li>it is recommended to create a new tax rate configured with the new requirements, rather than changing the original tax rate which can be still in use if required.     That way, there will be two tax rates which are exactly the same for a given organization but the rate (%) and the valid from date.</li> </ul> </li> <li>\"Tax Category\", as every tax rate must be linked to a given tax category as the way of grouping similar tax rates.</li> <li>\"Rate\", which is the % or rate of the tax</li> <li>\"Sales/Purchase Type\" as the way to distinguish between sales and purchase taxes.     The tax type is another variable which Etendo takes into account while retrieving the correct tax rate in either sales and purchase transactions. It is also a very valuable variable to take into account while reporting taxes as there are tax reports which require to submit purchase and sales tax information separately.     There is an additional option which is \"Both\", this option allows using the same tax rate for both purchase and sales transactions.</li> <li>\"Country/Region\" and \"Destination Country/Region\".     Tax such as VAT and US Sales Tax take into account from where/to where a transaction takes place in order to get it subject to the tax or not.     These two fields allow the user to enter that information by taking into account if the tax is a \"purchase\" or a \"sales\" tax type, therefore, when issuing a sales invoice from F&amp;B US Inc (USA Country and New York Region) to a customer also located in Destination Country USA and Destination Region New York, only the sales tax rates created within that specified Tax Zone would be applied.</li> <li>\"Summary Level\", a tax rate can be defined as summary which means it will have some tax rates underneath.     Summary tax rates are also set as \"Parent Tax Rate\" therefore its child tax rates can be linked to it.     For instance, a sales invoice is issued to a business partner under a specific VAT regime which includes an additional tax rate besides the VAT rate.     For this scenario, it is required to create three tax rates, the parent one as summary, and two more for the VAT rate and for the other rate, both of them linked to the parent. \"It is important to remark that when issuing the sales invoice for that business partner, the tax rate shown/selected is the summary or parent one.\"</li> <li>\"Base Amount\", which is the tax base amount to take into account in the tax amount calculation.

A tax rate can be set as exempt therefore it is the one automatically shown in the order/invoice lines created for a given Customer set as tax-exempt as well.</li> <li>Cash VAT.

Depending on the type selected, the required information to enter changes. There is no need to fill in the bank account information if the account type selected is \"Cash\".

There are many types of properties already created, besides modules can add new properties to that list with the aim of getting those other modules or even the system can use them by setting the corresponding properties values.   Some of the available properties are listed and briefly explained below:</li> <li>Enable UOM Management     If set to Value = \"Y\" at \"System\" level, it allows the user to define alternative UOM for a product, besides product's UOM.     Same way, a new field named \"Operative Quantity\" will then be shown in purchase, inventory and sales transaction documents, therefore \"Ordered Quantity\", \"Movement Quantity\" and \"Invoiced Quantity\" always shows \"Operative Quantity\" entered by the end-user, converted to the product's UOM.

This property avoids the C_BP_SOCREDITUSED_REFRESH function calculation.</li> <li>Implements an alternative Invoice Process button     This property is also assigned to the Advanced Payables and Receivables management module with a property value =\"Y\". This property avoids the usage of core invoice process button.</li> <li>Implements an alternative Financial Management     Same applies to this which allows an alternative financial management for that module.</li> <li>Implements Payment Monitor management     Same applies to this, which disables core's background process and button on the invoice header that manage the payment monitor.</li> <li>Recent views shown in the workspace property set to \"Y\"     This allows that the recent views are shown in the user workspace</li> <li>Show MRP and Production fields property set to \"Y\"     This allows that the MRP and production fields are shown</li> <li>Not allow changing exchange rate and amount     If you set this property with value = \"Y\", exchange rate and amount are read-only in Add Payment from Sales Invoice, Purchase Invoice, Payment In, Payment Out, Financial Account, in Select Expected Payments from Payment Proposal and in Funds Transfer from Financial Account.</li> <li>Write-off limit     This property with a property value =\"Y\" allows configuring write-off limit in Add Payment from Sales Invoice, Purchase Invoice, Payment In, Payment Out, Financial Account and in Select Expected Payments from Payment Proposal. The write-off limit is set for each Financial Account in Financial Account window.</li> <li>Show Product Characteristics Parents     Values can be 1,2,3,4, etc. The number means how many levels in the hierarchy tree the user wants to show in form view in the Product window. For example, if the tree is: Colour-&gt;Green-&gt;Green light-&gt;0034</li> <li>Allow Multiple Tabs of Window     If set to Value = 'Y' allows opening more than one tab of a single window.</li> <li>Attach By Default<ul> <li>If set to Value = 'Y' the \"Print Document\" popup will not be shown, this popup is the one which asks if the user want to attach the document or instead of it just print it without attaching.

A warning will be shown if the current role does not have access.</li> <li>If set to Value = 'N' or Undefined, it will not allow doing unsecured datasource request. It is required to have a role with enough access permissions. An OBSecurityException is thrown if current role does not have access.</li> </ul> </li> <li>External Rebuild, when this preference is defined as system level with its value set to Y, it will not be possible to rebuild the system from Module Manager Console after installing/updating modules. It forces rebuilding the system from command line.</li> <li>Bypass Access Level Entity Check, when this preference is defined with its value set to Y, it will allow bypassing the check that compares role's user level with entity's access level to completely prevent accessing latter one.</li> <li>Translate Yes/No Reference in Export To CSV, when this preference is defined with its value set to Y, the value of the columns whose reference is Yes/No will be translated to the current context language when exporting the grid of a standard window into CSV.</li> <li>Disable Linked Items Section, when this preference is defined for a window with its value set to Y, the Linked Items section will be disabled for that window. If there is not any window defined in the visibility settings, this section will be disabled for every window in the application.</li> <li>Enable Screen Reader, If this preference is set to Y the full screen reader will be enabled.

Two values are supported: XLS or XLSX. When this preference is not defined, XLSX is the default Excel export format.</li> <li>\"Filter by documents processed since N days ago\" is related to Create Lines From in Sales/Purchase Invoice. It limits transactions starting from the current date to the defined days ago.

This configuration is possible thanks to a feature known as Role Inheritance.</p> <p>Having a role, it is possible to assign one or more template roles to it.

This means that if a particular permission is inherited from multiple inheritance, the permission will be taken from the inheritance with higher sequence number.</p> <p>This process eases the role management, specially when the number of roles defined for a Client is high. Thus, it is possible to define template roles to give access for a particular set of elements, and then create multiple combinations of functional roles in order to give personalized access for the different users.

But following the common flows of a Role configuration, all the inheritances are calculated automatically, so this process is not necessary. For this reason, it remains hidden.</p> <p>As mentioned before, the changes (create, edit or remove) done in a permission which belongs to a template role will be propagated automatically to all the roles currently inheriting from it.

This way, each time that that product is selected, its attribute set value will be set to Medium (unless selected from stock, in which case the attribute set value is set to the value in which the product is stored).   It is possible to overwrite this attribute set value, to Small or Large for example.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Overwrite Specification: This means that the attribute set value will specify completely the product nevertheless, the attribute set value can be changed for this product.<ul> <li>For instance, product Alcohol Free Beer is given the attribute set Alcoholic Proof and the attribute set value 0% in the Product window. This definition specifies completely the product: the Alcohol Free Beer is supposed to have a 0% alcoholic proof. But, in the production process, some deviations can happen, and this alcoholic proof can go to 0.01%. Using Overwrite Specification option, the production manager will be allowed to register this deviation in the Production process for Alcohol Free Beer product.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Specification: This means that the attribute set value will specify completely the product. The attribute set value will always have this value and no other value will be allowed for it.<ul> <li>For instance, product Large Blue Jeans is given the attribute set Size &amp; Color with values Large and Blue. This defines the product and will not change. Transactions are done and completed with this product, without forcing to re-set the attribute set value.

So, in this example, instead of having a tax line where the amount is \u20ac5.84, the amount will be \u20ac5.83 (5.84-0.01)</p> <p>Finally, the total gross amount for the sales order would be 135.50 (129.67+5.83) which is the desired amount.</p> <p>Due to this (Net amount vs Gross amount), when using prices that include taxes, it is recommended to work with greater precision (price precision) to avoid rounding differences.</p> <ul> <li>When the price list does not include taxes, the gross unit price and line gross amount fields are not displayed and both fields are not calculated at all in the line of the document. The final gross amount of the document will be the result of the sum of the lines net amounts plus the tax amounts.</li> <li>The price list is defined at document level (header) so there cannot be lines where the price includes taxes and others where not. This is clear for orders, but for invoices where orders can be grouped in one just invoice the rule is also applied.

Being (Total Calculated Cost/Total Line Net Amount of Transactions with Calculated Cost) the Unitary Cost</p> <p>This means that the estimation is dependent on the retrieved records.

This CSV file has the prefix \u201cEBI_\u201d if it is an Etendo base query.
